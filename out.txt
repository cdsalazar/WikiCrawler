A bijective function, f: X → Y, from set X to set Y demonstrates that the sets have the same cardinality, in this case equal to the cardinal number 4.






Aleph null, the smallest infinite cardinal


In mathematics, cardinal numbers, or cardinals for short, are a generalization of the natural numbers used to measure the cardinality (size) of sets. The cardinality of a finite set is a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The transfinite cardinal numbers describe the sizes of infinite sets.
Cardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions. Two sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to Georg Cantor shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the cardinality of the set of real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set, something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.
There is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:



This sequence starts with the natural numbers including zero (finite cardinals), which are followed by the aleph numbers (infinite cardinals of well-ordered sets). The aleph numbers are indexed by ordinal numbers. Under the assumption of the axiom of choice, this transfinite sequence includes every cardinal number. If one rejects that axiom, the situation is more complicated, with additional infinite cardinals that are not alephs.
Cardinality is studied for its own sake as part of set theory. It is also a tool used in branches of mathematics including model theory, combinatorics, abstract algebra, and mathematical analysis. In category theory, the cardinal numbers form a skeleton of the category of sets.

History[edit]
The notion of cardinality, as now understood, was formulated by Georg Cantor, the originator of set theory, in 1874–1884. Cardinality can be used to compare an aspect of finite sets; e.g. the sets {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} are not equal, but have the same cardinality, namely three (this is established by the existence of a bijection, i.e. a one-to-one correspondence, between the two sets; e.g. {1-&gt;4, 2-&gt;5, 3-&gt;6}).
Cantor applied his concept of bijection to infinite sets;[1] e.g. the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Thus, all sets having a bijection with N he called denumerable (countably infinite) sets and they all have the same cardinal number. This cardinal number is called , aleph-null. He called the cardinal numbers of these infinite sets transfinite cardinal numbers.
Cantor proved that any unbounded subset of N has the same cardinality as N, even though this might appear to run contrary to intuition. He also proved that the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers is denumerable (which implies that the set of all rational numbers is denumerable), and later proved that the set of all algebraic numbers is also denumerable. Each algebraic number z may be encoded as a finite sequence of integers which are the coefficients in the polynomial equation of which it is the solution, i.e. the ordered n-tuple (a0, a1, ..., an), ai ∈ Z together with a pair of rationals (b0, b1) such that z is the unique root of the polynomial with coefficients (a0, a1, ..., an) that lies in the interval (b0, b1).
In his 1874 paper, Cantor proved that there exist higher-order cardinal numbers by showing that the set of real numbers has cardinality greater than that of N. His original presentation used a complex argument with nested intervals, but in an 1891 paper he proved the same result using his ingenious but simple diagonal argument. The new cardinal number of the set of real numbers is called the cardinality of the continuum and Cantor used the symbol  for it.
Cantor also developed a large portion of the general theory of cardinal numbers; he proved that there is a smallest transfinite cardinal number (, aleph-null) and that for every cardinal number, there is a next-larger cardinal



His continuum hypothesis is the proposition that  is the same as . This hypothesis has been found to be independent of the standard axioms of mathematical set theory; it can neither be proved nor disproved from the standard assumptions.
Motivation[edit]
In informal use, a cardinal number is what is normally referred to as a counting number, provided that 0 is included: 0, 1, 2, .... They may be identified with the natural numbers beginning with 0. The counting numbers are exactly what can be defined formally as the finite cardinal numbers. Infinite cardinals only occur in higher-level mathematics and logic.
More formally, a non-zero number can be used for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence. For finite sets and sequences it is easy to see that these two notions coincide, since for every number describing a position in a sequence we can construct a set which has exactly the right size, e.g. 3 describes the position of 'c' in the sequence &lt;'a','b','c','d',...&gt;, and we can construct the set {a,b,c} which has 3 elements. However when dealing with infinite sets it is essential to distinguish between the two — the two notions are in fact different for infinite sets. Considering the position aspect leads to ordinal numbers, while the size aspect is generalized by the cardinal numbers described here.
The intuition behind the formal definition of cardinal is the construction of a notion of the relative size or "bigness" of a set without reference to the kind of members which it has. For finite sets this is easy; one simply counts the number of elements a set has. In order to compare the sizes of larger sets, it is necessary to appeal to more subtle notions.
A set Y is at least as big as a set X if there is an injective mapping from the elements of X to the elements of Y. An injective mapping identifies each element of the set X with a unique element of the set Y. This is most easily understood by an example; suppose we have the sets X = {1,2,3} and Y = {a,b,c,d}, then using this notion of size we would observe that there is a mapping:

1 → a
2 → b
3 → c

which is injective, and hence conclude that Y has cardinality greater than or equal to X. Note the element d has no element mapping to it, but this is permitted as we only require an injective mapping, and not necessarily an injective and onto mapping. The advantage of this notion is that it can be extended to infinite sets.
We can then extend this to an equality-style relation. Two sets X and Y are said to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between X and Y. By the Schroeder–Bernstein theorem, this is equivalent to there being both an injective mapping from X to Y and an injective mapping from Y to X. We then write |X| = |Y|. The cardinal number of X itself is often defined as the least ordinal a with |a| = |X|. This is called the von Neumann cardinal assignment; for this definition to make sense, it must be proved that every set has the same cardinality as some ordinal; this statement is the well-ordering principle. It is however possible to discuss the relative cardinality of sets without explicitly assigning names to objects.
The classic example used is that of the infinite hotel paradox, also called Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel. Suppose you are an innkeeper at a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. The hotel is full, and then a new guest arrives. It is possible to fit the extra guest in by asking the guest who was in room 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on, leaving room 1 vacant. We can explicitly write a segment of this mapping:

1 → 2
2 → 3
3 → 4
...
n → n + 1
...

In this way we can see that the set {1,2,3,...} has the same cardinality as the set {2,3,4,...} since a bijection between the first and the second has been shown. This motivates the definition of an infinite set being any set which has a proper subset of the same cardinality; in this case {2,3,4,...} is a proper subset of {1,2,3,...}.
When considering these large objects, we might also want to see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets. It happens that it doesn't; by considering the above example we can see that if some object "one greater than infinity" exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started out with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called ordinals, based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.
It can be proved that the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than that of the natural numbers just described. This can be visualized using Cantor's diagonal argument; classic questions of cardinality (for instance the continuum hypothesis) are concerned with discovering whether there is some cardinal between some pair of other infinite cardinals. In more recent times mathematicians have been describing the properties of larger and larger cardinals.
Since cardinality is such a common concept in mathematics, a variety of names are in use. Sameness of cardinality is sometimes referred to as equipotence, equipollence, or equinumerosity. It is thus said that two sets with the same cardinality are, respectively, equipotent, equipollent, or equinumerous.
Formal definition[edit]
Formally, assuming the axiom of choice, the cardinality of a set X is the least ordinal α such that there is a bijection between X and α. This definition is known as the von Neumann cardinal assignment. If the axiom of choice is not assumed we need to do something different. The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set X (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and Principia Mathematica) is as the class [X] of all sets that are equinumerous with X. This does not work in ZFC or other related systems of axiomatic set theory because if X is non-empty, this collection is too large to be a set. In fact, for X ≠ ∅ there is an injection from the universe into [X] by mapping a set m to {m} × X and so by the axiom of limitation of size, [X] is a proper class. The definition does work however in type theory and in New Foundations and related systems. However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with X that have the least rank, then it will work (this is a trick due to Dana Scott:[2] it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).
Formally, the order among cardinal numbers is defined as follows: |X| ≤ |Y| means that there exists an injective function from X to Y. The Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem states that if |X| ≤ |Y| and |Y| ≤ |X| then |X| = |Y|. The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that given two sets X and Y, either |X| ≤ |Y| or |Y| ≤ |X|.[3][4]
A set X is Dedekind-infinite if there exists a proper subset Y of X with |X| = |Y|, and Dedekind-finite if such a subset doesn't exist. The finite cardinals are just the natural numbers, i.e., a set X is finite if and only if |X| = |n| = n for some natural number n. Any other set is infinite. Assuming the axiom of choice, it can be proved that the Dedekind notions correspond to the standard ones. It can also be proved that the cardinal  (aleph null or aleph-0, where aleph is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, represented ) of the set of natural numbers is the smallest infinite cardinal, i.e. that any infinite set has a subset of cardinality  The next larger cardinal is denoted by  and so on. For every ordinal α there is a cardinal number  and this list exhausts all infinite cardinal numbers.
Cardinal arithmetic[edit]
We can define arithmetic operations on cardinal numbers that generalize the ordinary operations for natural numbers. It can be shown that for finite cardinals these operations coincide with the usual operations for natural numbers. Furthermore, these operations share many properties with ordinary arithmetic.
Successor cardinal[edit]
For more details on this topic, see Successor cardinal.
If the axiom of choice holds, every cardinal κ has a successor κ+ &gt; κ, and there are no cardinals between κ and its successor. (Without the axiom of choice, using Hartogs' theorem, it can be shown that, for any cardinal number κ, there is a minimal cardinal κ+, so that ) For finite cardinals, the successor is simply κ + 1. For infinite cardinals, the successor cardinal differs from the successor ordinal.
Cardinal addition[edit]
If X and Y are disjoint, addition is given by the union of X and Y. If the two sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by disjoint sets of the same cardinality, e.g., replace X by X×{0} and Y by Y×{1}.



Zero is an additive identity κ + 0 = 0 + κ = κ.
Addition is associative (κ + μ) + ν = κ + (μ + ν).
Addition is commutative κ + μ = μ + κ.
Addition is non-decreasing in both arguments:



Assuming the axiom of choice, addition of infinite cardinal numbers is easy. If either κ or μ is infinite, then



Subtraction[edit]
Assuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal σ and a cardinal μ, there exists a cardinal κ such that μ + κ = σ if and only if μ ≤ σ. It will be unique (and equal to σ) if and only if μ &lt; σ.
Cardinal multiplication[edit]
The product of cardinals comes from the cartesian product.



κ·0 = 0·κ = 0.
κ·μ = 0 → (κ = 0 or μ = 0).
One is a multiplicative identity κ·1 = 1·κ = κ.
Multiplication is associative (κ·μ)·ν = κ·(μ·ν).
Multiplication is commutative κ·μ = μ·κ.
Multiplication is non-decreasing in both arguments: κ ≤ μ → (κ·ν ≤ μ·ν and ν·κ ≤ ν·μ).
Multiplication distributes over addition: κ·(μ + ν) = κ·μ + κ·ν and (μ + ν)·κ = μ·κ + ν·κ.
Assuming the axiom of choice, multiplication of infinite cardinal numbers is also easy. If either κ or μ is infinite and both are non-zero, then



Division[edit]
Assuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal π and a non-zero cardinal μ, there exists a cardinal κ such that μ · κ = π if and only if μ ≤ π. It will be unique (and equal to π) if and only if μ &lt; π.
Cardinal exponentiation[edit]
Exponentiation is given by



where XY is the set of all functions from Y to X.

κ0 = 1 (in particular 00 = 1), see empty function.
If 1 ≤ μ, then 0μ = 0.
1μ = 1.
κ1 = κ.
κμ + ν = κμ·κν.
κμ · ν = (κμ)ν.
(κ·μ)ν = κν·μν.

Exponentiation is non-decreasing in both arguments:

(1 ≤ ν and κ ≤ μ) → (νκ ≤ νμ) and
(κ ≤ μ) → (κν ≤ μν).

Note that 2|X| is the cardinality of the power set of the set X and Cantor's diagonal argument shows that 2|X| &gt; |X| for any set X. This proves that no largest cardinal exists (because for any cardinal κ, we can always find a larger cardinal 2κ). In fact, the class of cardinals is a proper class. (This proof fails in some set theories, notably New Foundations.)
All the remaining propositions in this section assume the axiom of choice:

If κ and μ are both finite and greater than 1, and ν is infinite, then κν = μν.
If κ is infinite and μ is finite and non-zero, then κμ = κ.

If 2 ≤ κ and 1 ≤ μ and at least one of them is infinite, then:

Max (κ, 2μ) ≤ κμ ≤ Max (2κ, 2μ).

Using König's theorem, one can prove κ &lt; κcf(κ) and κ &lt; cf(2κ) for any infinite cardinal κ, where cf(κ) is the cofinality of κ.
Roots[edit]
Assuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal κ and a finite cardinal μ greater than 0, the cardinal ν satisfying  will be κ.
Logarithms[edit]
Assuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal κ and a finite cardinal μ greater than 1, there may or may not be a cardinal λ satisfying . However, if such a cardinal exists, it is infinite and less than κ, and any finite cardinality ν greater than 1 will also satisfy .
The logarithm of an infinite cardinal number κ is defined as the least cardinal number μ such that κ ≤ 2μ. Logarithms of infinite cardinals are useful in some fields of mathematics, for example in the study of cardinal invariants of topological spaces, though they lack some of the properties that logarithms of positive real numbers possess.[5][6][7]
The continuum hypothesis[edit]
The continuum hypothesis (CH) states that there are no cardinals strictly between  and  The latter cardinal number is also often denoted by ; it is the cardinality of the continuum (the set of real numbers). In this case  The generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) states that for every infinite set X, there are no cardinals strictly between |&#160;X&#160;| and 2|&#160;X&#160;|. The continuum hypothesis is independent of the usual axioms of set theory, the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms together with the axiom of choice (ZFC).

The Virginia class, also known as the SSN-774 class, is a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (hull classification symbol SSN) in service with the United States Navy. The submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions. They were conceived as a less expensive alternative to the Seawolf-class attack submarines, designed during the Cold War era, and they are planned to replace the older of the Los Angeles-class&#160;submarine, many of which have already been decommissioned. The class was developed under the codename Centurion, renamed to NSSN (New SSN) later on.[4] The "Centurion Study" was initiated in February 1991.[5] Virginia-class submarines will be acquired through 2043, and are expected to remain in service past 2060.[6] Based on recent updates to the designs, some of the Virginia-class submarines are expected to still be in service in 2070.[7]

Instead of a traditional periscope, the class utilizes a pair of AN/BVS-1 telescoping photonics masts[8] located outside the pressure hull. Each mast contains high-resolution cameras, along with light-intensification and infrared sensors, an infrared laser rangefinder, and an integrated Electronic Support Measures (ESM) array. Signals from the masts' sensors are transmitted through optical fiber data lines through signal processors to the control center.[9] Visual feeds from the masts are displayed on liquid-crystal display interfaces in the command center.[10]
The Photonics Masts are built by L-3 KEO[11] (previously Kollmorgen)[12][13]
The design of earlier optical periscopes required them to penetrate the pressure hull, reducing the structural integrity of the pressure hull as well as increasing the risk of flooding, and also required the submarine's control room to be located directly below the sail/fin.[14] Implementation of photonics masts (which do not penetrate the pressure hull) enabled the submarine control room to be relocated to a position inside the pressure hull which is not necessarily directly below the sail.[15]
Photonics Masts have a unique visual appearance which distinctly identify the submarine as a U.S. Navy vessel, if detected. Therefore, they will be replaced with Low-Profile Photonics Masts (LPPM) which better resemble traditional submarine periscopes.[15]
In the future, a non-rotational Affordable Modular Panoramic Photonics Mast may be fitted, enabling the submarine to obtain a simultaneous 360° view of the sea surface.[16][17]
Photonics Masts are mounted to the Universal Modular Mast (UMM), first installed on USS&#160;Memphis, a Los Angeles-class submarine.[18] The UMM is an integrated system for housing, erecting, and supporting submarine mast-mounted antennas and sensors. The UMM on Virginia-class submarines is used to accommodate eight mast-mounted sensors.[19] Apart from two Photonics Masts, the UMM also accommodates:[15]

two (tactical) communication masts[15]
one or two high-data-rate satellite communication (SATCOM) masts,[20] built by Raytheon,[21] enabling communication at Super High Frequency (for downlink) and Extremely High Frequency (for uplink) range[21][22]
radar mast (carrying AN/BPS-16 surface search and navigation radar)[23]
electronic warfare mast (AN/BLQ-10 Electronic Support Measures) used to detect, analyze, and identify both radar and communication signals from ships, aircraft, submarines, and land-based transmitters[24][25][26]
snorkel mast

Propulsor[edit]
In contrast to a traditional bladed propeller, the Virginia class uses pump-jet propulsors (built by BAE Systems),[27] originally developed for the Royal Navy's Swiftsure-class&#160;submarines.[28] The propulsor significantly reduces the risks of cavitation, and allows quieter operation.
Improved sonar systems[edit]
Sonar arrays aboard Virginia-class submarines have an "Open System Architecture" (OSA) which enables rapid insertion of new hardware and software as they become available. Hardware upgrades (dubbed Technology Insertions) are usually carried out every four years, while software updates (dubbed Advanced Processor Builds) are carried out every two years. Virginia-class submarines feature several types of sonar arrays.[29]

BQQ-10 bow-mounted spherical active/passive sonar array[29][30] (Large Aperture Bow (LAB) sonar array from SSN-784 onwards)
A wide aperture lightweight fiber optic sonar array, consisting of three flat panels mounted low along either side of the hull[31]
Two high frequency active sonars mounted in the sail and bow. The chin-mounted (below the bow) and sail-mounted high frequency sonars supplement the (spherical/LAB) main sonar array, enabling safer operations in coastal waters, enhancing under-ice navigation, and improving anti-submarine warfare performance.[32][33]


Low-Cost Conformal Array (LCCA) high frequency sonar, mounted on both sides of the submarines sail. Provides coverage above and behind the submarine.[34]

Virginia-class submarines are also equipped with a low frequency towed sonar array and a high frequency towed sonar array.[35]

TB-16 or TB-34 fat line tactical towed sonar array[36][37]
TB-29 or TB-33 thin line long-range search towed sonar array[36][37]

History[edit]
Virginia-class submarines were the first US Navy warships designed with the help of computer-aided design (CAD) and visualization technology.[10][49] By 2007 approximately 35 million labor hours were spent on designing the Virginia-class.[50] Around 9 million labor hours are required for the construction and completion of a single Virginia-class submarine.[49][51][52] Over 4,000 suppliers are involved in the construction of the Virginia class.[53] Each submarine is projected to make 14–15 deployments during its 33-year service life.[54]
The Virginia class was intended in part as a cheaper alternative to the Seawolf-class submarines ($1.8 billion vs $2.8 billion), whose production run was stopped after just three boats had been completed. To reduce costs, the Virginia-class submarines use many "commercial off-the-shelf" (COTS) components, especially in their computers and data networks. In practice, they actually cost less than $1.8 billion (in fiscal year 2009 dollars) each, due to improvements in shipbuilding technology.[8]
In hearings before both House of Representatives and Senate committees, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) and expert witnesses testified that the procurement plans of the Virginia class – one per year, accelerating to two per year beginning in 2012 – would result in high unit costs and an insufficient number of attack submarines, according to some of the witnesses and the committee chairman.[55] In a 10 March 2005 statement to the House Armed Services Committee, Ronald O'Rourke of the CRS testified that, assuming that the production rate remains as planned, "production economies of scale for submarines would continue to remain limited or poor."[56]
In 2001, Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat Company built a quarter-scale version of a Virginia-class submarine dubbed Large Scale Vehicle II (LSV II) Cutthroat. The vehicle was designed as an affordable test platform for new technologies.[57][58]
The Virginia-class is built through an industrial arrangement designed to keep both GD Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company (the only two U.S. shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered vessels) in the submarine-building business.[59] Under the present arrangement, the Newport News facility builds the stern, habitability, and machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room and control room. The facilities alternate work on the reactor plant as well as the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery.
O’Rourke wrote in 2004 that, "Compared to a one-yard strategy, approaches involving two yards may be more expensive but offer potential offsetting benefits."[1] Among the claims of "offsetting benefits" that O'Rourke attributes to supporters of a two-facility construction arrangement is that it "would permit the United States to continue building submarines at one yard even if the other yard is rendered incapable of building submarines permanently or for a sustained period of time by a catastrophic event of some kind", including an enemy attack.
In order to get the submarine's price down to $2 billion per submarine in FY-05 dollars, the Navy instituted a cost-reduction program to shave off approximately $400 million of each submarine's price tag. The project was dubbed "2 for 4 in 12," referring to the Navy's desire to buy two boats for $4&#160;billion in FY-12. Under pressure from Congress, the Navy opted to start buying two boats per year in FY-11, meaning that officials would not be able to get the $2&#160;billion price tag before the service started buying two submarines per year. However, program manager Dave Johnson said at a conference on 19 March 2008 that the program was only $30&#160;million away from achieving the $2&#160;billion price goal, and would reach that target on schedule.[60]
The Virginia Class Program Office received the David Packard Excellence in Acquisition Award in 1996, 1998, 2008, "for excelling in four specific award criteria: reducing life-cycle costs; making the acquisition system more efficient, responsive, and timely; integrating defense with the commercial base and practices; and promoting continuous improvement of the acquisition process".[61]
In December 2008, the Navy signed a $14 billion contract with General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman to supply eight submarines. The contractors will deliver one submarine in each of fiscal 2009 and 2010, and two submarines on each of fiscal 2011, 2012, and 2013.[62] This contract will bring the Navy's Virginia-class fleet to 18 submarines. And in December 2010, the United States Congress passed a defense authorization bill that expanded production to two subs per year.[63] Two submarine-per-year production resumed on 2 September 2011 with commencement of Washington&#160;(SSN-787) construction.[2]
On 21 June 2008, the Navy christened New Hampshire&#160;(SSN-778), the first Block II submarine. This boat was delivered eight months ahead of schedule and $54&#160;million under budget. Block&#160;II boats are built in four sections, compared to the ten sections of the Block I boats. This enables a cost saving of about $300 million per boat, reducing the overall cost to $2 billion per boat and the construction of two new boats per year. Beginning in 2010, new submarines of this class will include a software system that can monitor and reduce their electromagnetic signatures when needed.[64]
The first full-duration six-month deployment was successfully carried out from 15 October 2009 to 13 April 2010.[65] Authorization of full-rate production and the declaration of full operational capability was achieved five months later.[66] In September 2010, it was found that urethane tiles, applied to the hull to damp internal sound and absorb rather than reflect sonar pulses, were falling off while the subs were at sea.[67] Admiral Kevin McCoy announced that the problems with the Mold-in-Place Special Hull Treatment for the early subs had been fixed in 2011, then the Minnesota was built and found to have the same problem.[68]
Professor Ross Babbage of the Australian National University has called on Australia to buy or lease a dozen Virginia class submarines from the United States, rather than locally build 12 replacements for its Collins-class submarines.[69]
In 2013, just as two-per-year sub construction was supposed to commence, Congress failed to resolve the United States fiscal cliff, forcing the Navy to attempt to "de-obligate" construction funds.[70]
Technology barriers[edit]
Because of the low rate of Virginia production, the Navy entered into a program with DARPA to overcome technology barriers to lower the cost of attack submarines so that more could be built, to maintain the size of the fleet.[71]
These include:[72]

Propulsion concepts not constrained by a centerline shaft.
Externally stowed and launched weapons (especially torpedoes).
Conformal alternatives to the existing spherical sonar array.
Technologies that eliminate or substantially simplify existing submarine hull, mechanical, and electrical systems.
Automation to reduce crew workload for standard tasks

Virginia Payload Module[edit]
The Block III submarines have two multipurpose Virginia Payload Tubes (VPT) replacing the dozen single purpose cruise missile launch tubes.[73]
The Block V submarines built from 2019 onward will have an additional Virginia Payload Module (VPM) mid-body section, increasing their overall length. The VPM will add four more VPTs of the same diameter and greater height, located on the centerline, carrying up to seven Tomahawk missiles apiece, that would replace some of the capabilities lost when the SSGN conversion Ohio-class&#160;submarines are retired from the fleet.[1][74] Initially eight payload tubes/silos were planned[74] but this was later rejected in favour of 4 tubes installed in a 70-foot long module between the operations compartment and the propulsion spaces.[74][75][76]
The VPM could potentially carry (non-nuclear) medium-range ballistic missiles. Adding the VPM would increase the cost of each submarine by $500 million (2012 prices).[77] This additional cost would be offset by reducing the total submarine force by four ships.[78] More recent reports state that as a cost reduction measure the VPM would carry only Tomahawk SLCM and possibly unmanned undersea vehicles (UUV) with the new price tag now estimated at $360–380 million per boat (in 2010 prices). The VPM launch tubes/silos will reportedly be similar in design to the ones planned for the Ohio class replacement.[79][80] As of September 2013[update] the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) was still hoping to field the VPM from 2027,[81] but deployment now seems unlikely since the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) moved the program in February 2013 from the 'Prompt Strike' budget to the main Navy shipbuilding account, which is already under financial pressure.[82]

Boats[edit]
Block I[edit]
Modular construction techniques were incorporated during construction.[92] Earlier submarines (e.g., Los Angeles-class SSNs) were built by assembling the pressure hull and then installing the equipment via cavities in the pressure hull. This required extensive construction activities within the narrow confines of the pressure hull which was time-consuming and dangerous. Modular construction was implemented in an effort to overcome these problems and make the construction process more efficient. Modular construction techniques incorporated during construction include constructing large segments of equipment outside the hull. These segments (dubbed rafts) are then inserted into a hull section (a large segment of the pressure hull). The integrated raft and hull section form a module which, when joined with other modules, forms a Virginia-class submarine.[93] Block I boats were built in 10 modules with each submarine requiring roughly 7 years (84 months) to build.[94]

Block II[edit]
Block II boats were built in four sections rather than ten sections, saving about $300 million per boat. Block II boats (excluding SSN-778) were also built under a multi-year procurement agreement as opposed to a block-buy contract in Block I, enabling savings in the range of $400 million ($80 million per boat).[1][54] As a result of improvements in the construction process, New Hampshire (SSN-778) was 500 million USD cheaper, required 3.7 million fewer labor hours to build (25% less) thus shortening the construction period by 15 months (20% less) compared to USS Virginia (SSN-774).[93]

SSN-784 through approximately SSN-791 are planned to make up the Third Block or "Flight" and began construction in 2009. Block III subs feature a revised bow with a Large Aperture Bow (LAB) sonar array, as well as technology from Ohio-class SSGNs (2 VLS tubes each containing 6 missiles).[107] The horseshoe-shaped LAB sonar array replaces the spherical main sonar array which has been used on all U.S. Navy SSNs since 1960.[54][108][109] The LAB sonar array is water-backed—as opposed to earlier sonar arrays which were air-backed—and consists of a passive array and a medium-frequency active array.[110] Compared to earlier Virginia class submarines about 40% of the bow has been redesigned.[clarification needed][111]

Block IV[edit]
In 2013 execution of a 10-submarine contract was put in doubt by Budget sequestration in 2013.[127] The most costly shipbuilding contract in history was awarded on 28 April 2014 as prime contractor General Dynamics Electric Boat took on a $17.6 billion contract for ten Block IV Virginia-class attack submarines. The main improvement over the Block III is the reduction of major maintenance periods from four to three, increasing each ship's total lifetime deployments by one.[128]
The long-lead-time materials contract for SSN 792 was awarded on 17 April 2012, with SSN 793 and SSN 794 following on 28 December 2012.[129][130] the U.S. Navy has awarded General Dynamics Electric Boat a $208.6 million contract modification for the second fiscal year (FY) 14 Virginia-class submarine, SSN-793, and two FY 15 submarines, SSN-794 and SSN-795. With this modification, the overall contract is worth $595 million.[131] Block IV will consist of 9-10 submarines.[132] Based on the planned split between block IV and block V boats, the block IV procurement should comprise the following hull numbers.[133]

Future acquisitions[edit]
The Navy plans to acquire at least 30 Virginia-class submarines,[144][145] however, more recent data provided by the Naval Submarine League (in 2011) and the Congressional Budget Office (in 2012) seems to imply that more than 30 may eventually be built. The Naval Submarine League believes that up to 10&#160;Block&#160;V boats will be built.[52][146] The same source also states that 10 additional submarines could be built after Block&#160;V submarines, with 5 in the so-called Block&#160;VI and 5 in Block&#160;VII, largely due to the delays experienced with the "Improved Virginia". These 20&#160;submarines (10&#160;Block&#160;V, 5&#160;Block&#160;VI, 5&#160;Block&#160;VII) would carry VPM bringing the total number of Virginia-class submarines to 48 (including the 28&#160;submarines in Blocks I, II, III and IV). The CBO in its 2012 report states that 33&#160;Virginia-class submarines will be procured in the 2013–2032 timeframe,[3] resulting in 49&#160;submarines in total since 16 were already procured by the end of 2012.[132] Such a long production run seems unlikely but it should be noted that another naval program, the Arleigh Burke-class&#160;destroyer, is still ongoing even though the first vessel was procured in 1985.[147][148] However, other sources believe that production will end with Block&#160;V.[149] In addition, data provided in CBO reports tends to vary considerably compared to earlier editions.[3]

SSN(X)/Improved Virginia[edit]
Initially dubbed Future Attack Submarine[150] and Improved Virginia-class in Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports,[3] the SSN(X) or Improved Virginia-class submarines will be an evolved version of the Virginia-class.[3]
In late 2014, the Navy began early preparation work on the SSN(X). It was planned that the first submarine would be procured in 2025. However, their introduction (i.e., procurement of the first submarine) has been pushed back to 2033/2034.[3][151] The long-range shipbuilding plan is for the new SSN to be authorized in 2034, and become operational by 2044 after the last Block VII Virginia is built. Roughly a decade will be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe. One area already identified is the need to integrate with off-board systems so future Virginia boats and the SSN(X) can employ networked, extremely long-ranged weapons. A torpedo propulsion system concept from the Pennsylvania State University could allow a torpedo to hit a target 200&#160;nmi (230&#160;mi; 370&#160;km) away and be guided by another asset during the terminal phase. Targeting information might also come from another platform like a patrol aircraft or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launched from the submarine.[152]

Life[edit]
He was educated at Charles University (his adviser was Petr Vopěnka) and is now at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
Work[edit]
Jech's research also includes mathematical logic, algebra, analysis, topology and measure theory.
Jech gave the first published proof of the consistency of the existence of a Suslin line. With Karel Prikry, he introduced the notion of precipitous ideal. He gave several models where AC failed, for example one with ω1 measurable. The concept of a Jech–Kunen tree is named after him and Kenneth Kunen.

Paul Richard Halmos (Hungarian: Halmos Pál; March 3, 1916 – October 2, 2006) was a Hungarian-Jewish-born American mathematician who made fundamental advances in the areas of mathematical logic, probability theory, statistics, operator theory, ergodic theory, and functional analysis (in particular, Hilbert spaces). He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor.

Early life and education[edit]
Halmos arrived in the U.S. at 13 years of age, but never lost his Hungarian accent. Halmos obtained his B.A. from the University of Illinois, majoring in mathematics, but fulfilling the requirements for both a math and philosophy degree. He took only three years to obtain the degree, and was only 19 when he graduated. He then began a Ph.D. in philosophy; but, after failing his masters' oral exams,[1] he shifted to mathematics, graduating in 1938. Joseph L. Doob supervised his dissertation, titled Invariants of Certain Stochastic Transformations: The Mathematical Theory of Gambling Systems.
Career[edit]
Shortly after his graduation, Halmos left for the Institute for Advanced Study, lacking both job and grant money. Six months later, he was working under John von Neumann, which proved a decisive experience. While at the Institute, Halmos wrote his first book, Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces, which immediately established his reputation as a fine expositor of mathematics.
Halmos taught at Syracuse University, the University of Chicago (1946–60), the University of Michigan, the University of California at Santa Barbara (1976–78), the University of Hawaii, and Indiana University. From his 1985 retirement from Indiana until his death, he was affiliated with the Mathematics department at Santa Clara University.
Accomplishments[edit]
In a series of papers reprinted in his 1962 Algebraic Logic, Halmos devised polyadic algebras, an algebraic version of first-order logic differing from the better known cylindric algebras of Alfred Tarski and his students. An elementary version of polyadic algebra is described in monadic Boolean algebra.
In addition to his original contributions to mathematics, Halmos was an unusually clear and engaging expositor of university mathematics. He won the Lester R. Ford Award in 1971[2] and again in 1977 (shared with W. P. Ziemer, W. H. Wheeler, S. H. Moolgavkar, J. H. Ewing and W. H. Gustafson).[3] Halmos chaired the American Mathematical Society committee that wrote the AMS style guide for academic mathematics, published in 1973. In 1983, he received the AMS's Steele Prize for exposition.
In the American Scientist 56(4): 375–389, Halmos argued that mathematics is a creative art, and that mathematicians should be seen as artists, not number crunchers. He discussed the division of the field into mathology and mathophysics, further arguing that mathematicians and painters think and work in related ways.
Halmos's 1985 "automathography" I Want to Be a Mathematician is an account of what it was like to be an academic mathematician in 20th century America. He called the book "automathography" rather than "autobiography", because its focus is almost entirely on his life as a mathematician, not his personal life. The book contains the following quote on Halmos' view of what doing mathematics means:

Don't just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?




What does it take to be [a mathematician]? I think I know the answer: you have to be born right, you must continually strive to become perfect, you must love mathematics more than anything else, you must work at it hard and without stop, and you must never give up.


Paul Halmos, 1985

In these memoirs, Halmos claims to have invented the "iff" notation for the words "if and only if" and to have been the first to use the “tombstone” notation to signify the end of a proof,[4] and this is generally agreed to be the case. The tombstone symbol ∎ (Unicode U+220E) is sometimes called a halmos.[5]
In 2005, Halmos and his wife Virginia funded the Euler Book Prize, an annual award given by the Mathematical Association of America for a book that is likely to improve the view of mathematics among the public. The first prize was given in 2007, the 300th anniversary of Leonhard Euler's birth, to John Derbyshire for his book about Bernhard Riemann and the Riemann hypothesis: Prime Obsession.[6]

			Banach–Tarski paradox
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				



Can a ball be decomposed into a finite number of point sets and reassembled into two balls identical to the original?


The Banach–Tarski paradox is a theorem in set-theoretic geometry, which states the following: Given a solid ball in 3‑dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, which can then be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball. Indeed, the reassembly process involves only moving the pieces around and rotating them, without changing their shape. However, the pieces themselves are not "solids" in the usual sense, but infinite scatterings of points. The reconstruction can work with as few as five pieces.[1]
A stronger form of the theorem implies that given any two "reasonable" solid objects (such as a small ball and a huge ball), either one can be reassembled into the other. This is often stated informally as "a pea can be chopped up and reassembled into the Sun" and called the "pea and the Sun paradox".
The reason the Banach–Tarski theorem is called a paradox is that it contradicts basic geometric intuition. "Doubling the ball" by dividing it into parts and moving them around by rotations and translations, without any stretching, bending, or adding new points, seems to be impossible, since all these operations ought, intuitively speaking, to preserve the volume. The intuition that such operations preserve volumes is not mathematically absurd and it is even included in the formal definition of volumes. However, this is not applicable here, because in this case it is impossible to define the volumes of the considered subsets, as they are chosen with such a large porosity. Reassembling them reproduces a volume, which happens to be different from the volume at the start.
Unlike most theorems in geometry, the proof of this result depends in a critical way on the choice of axioms for set theory. It can be proven using the axiom of choice, which allows for the construction of nonmeasurable sets, i.e., collections of points that do not have a volume in the ordinary sense, and whose construction requires an uncountable number of choices.[2]
It was shown in 2005 that the pieces in the decomposition can be chosen in such a way that they can be moved continuously into place without running into one another.[3]

Banach and Tarski publication[edit]
In a paper published in 1924,[4] Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski gave a construction of such a paradoxical decomposition, based on earlier work by Giuseppe Vitali concerning the unit interval and on the paradoxical decompositions of the sphere by Felix Hausdorff, and discussed a number of related questions concerning decompositions of subsets of Euclidean spaces in various dimensions. They proved the following more general statement, the strong form of the Banach–Tarski paradox:

Given any two bounded subsets A and B of an Euclidean space in at least three dimensions, both of which have a nonempty interior, there are partitions of A and B into a finite number of disjoint subsets, A = A1 ∪ ... ∪ Ak, B = B1 ∪ ... ∪ Bk, such that for each i between 1 and k, the sets Ai and Bi are congruent.

Now let A be the original ball and B be the union of two translated copies of the original ball. Then the proposition means that you can divide the original ball A into a certain number of pieces and then rotate and translate these pieces in such a way that the result is the whole set B, which contains two copies of A.
The strong form of the Banach–Tarski paradox is false in dimensions one and two, but Banach and Tarski showed that an analogous statement remains true if countably many subsets are allowed. The difference between the dimensions 1 and 2 on the one hand, and three and higher, on the other hand, is due to the richer structure of the group E(n) of the Euclidean motions in the higher dimensions, which is solvable for n = 1, 2 and contains a free group with two generators for n ≥ 3. John von Neumann studied the properties of the group of equivalences that make a paradoxical decomposition possible and introduced the notion of amenable groups. He also found a form of the paradox in the plane which uses area-preserving affine transformations in place of the usual congruences.
Tarski proved that amenable groups are precisely those for which no paradoxical decompositions exist. Since only free subgroups are needed in the Banach–Tarski paradox, this led to the long-standing Von Neumann conjecture.
Formal treatment[edit]
The Banach–Tarski paradox states that a ball in the ordinary Euclidean space can be doubled using only the operations of partitioning into subsets, replacing a set with a congruent set, and reassembly. Its mathematical structure is greatly elucidated by emphasizing the role played by the group of Euclidean motions and introducing the notions of equidecomposable sets and paradoxical set. Suppose that G is a group acting on a set X. In the most important special case, X is an n-dimensional Euclidean space, and G consists of all isometries of X, i.e. the transformations of X into itself that preserve the distances, usually denoted E(n). Two geometric figures that can be transformed into each other are called congruent, and this terminology will be extended to the general G-action. Two subsets A and B of X are called G-equidecomposable, or equidecomposable with respect to G, if A and B can be partitioned into the same finite number of respectively G-congruent pieces. This defines an equivalence relation among all subsets of X. Formally, if



then we will say that A and B are G-equidecomposable using k pieces. If a set E has two disjoint subsets A and B such that A and E, as well as B and E, are G-equidecomposable then E is called paradoxical.
Using this terminology, the Banach–Tarski paradox can be reformulated as follows:

A three-dimensional Euclidean ball is equidecomposable with two copies of itself.

In fact, there is a sharp result in this case, due to R. M. Robinson:[5] doubling the ball can be accomplished with five pieces, and fewer than five pieces will not suffice.
The strong version of the paradox claims:

Any two bounded subsets of 3-dimensional Euclidean space with non-empty interiors are equidecomposable.

While apparently more general, this statement is derived in a simple way from the doubling of a ball by using a generalization of the Bernstein–Schroeder theorem due to Banach that implies that if A is equidecomposable with a subset of B and B is equidecomposable with a subset of A, then A and B are equidecomposable.
The Banach–Tarski paradox can be put in context by pointing out that for two sets in the strong form of the paradox, there is always a bijective function that can map the points in one shape into the other in a one-to-one fashion. In the language of Georg Cantor's set theory, these two sets have equal cardinality. Thus, if one enlarges the group to allow arbitrary bijections of X then all sets with non-empty interior become congruent. Likewise, we can make one ball into a larger or smaller ball by stretching, in other words, by applying similarity transformations. Hence if the group G is large enough, we may find G-equidecomposable sets whose "size" varies. Moreover, since a countable set can be made into two copies of itself, one might expect that somehow, using countably many pieces could do the trick.
On the other hand, in the Banach–Tarski paradox the number of pieces is finite and the allowed equivalences are Euclidean congruences, which preserve the volumes. Yet, somehow, they end up doubling the volume of the ball! While this is certainly surprising, some of the pieces used in the paradoxical decomposition are non-measurable sets, so the notion of volume (more precisely, Lebesgue measure) is not defined for them, and the partitioning cannot be accomplished in a practical way. In fact, the Banach–Tarski paradox demonstrates that it is impossible to find a finitely-additive measure (or a Banach measure) defined on all subsets of a Euclidean space of three (and greater) dimensions that is invariant with respect to Euclidean motions and takes the value one on a unit cube. In his later work, Tarski showed that, conversely, non-existence of paradoxical decompositions of this type implies the existence of a finitely-additive invariant measure.
The heart of the proof of the "doubling the ball" form of the paradox presented below is the remarkable fact that by a Euclidean isometry (and renaming of elements), one can divide a certain set (essentially, the surface of a unit sphere) into four parts, then rotate one of them to become itself plus two of the other parts. This follows rather easily from a F2-paradoxical decomposition of F2, the free group with two generators. Banach and Tarski's proof relied on an analogous fact discovered by Hausdorff some years earlier: the surface of a unit sphere in space is a disjoint union of three sets B, C, D and a countable set E such that, on the one hand, B, C, D are pairwise congruent, and, on the other hand, B is congruent with the union of C and D. This is often called the Hausdorff paradox.
Connection with earlier work and the role of the axiom of choice[edit]
Banach and Tarski explicitly acknowledge Giuseppe Vitali's 1905 construction of the set bearing his name, Hausdorff's paradox (1914), and an earlier (1923) paper of Banach as the precursors to their work. Vitali's and Hausdorff's constructions depend on Zermelo's axiom of choice ("AC"), which is also crucial to the Banach–Tarski paper, both for proving their paradox and for the proof of another result:

Two Euclidean polygons, one of which strictly contains the other, are not equidecomposable.

They remark:

Le rôle que joue cet axiome dans nos raisonnements nous semble mériter l'attention
(The role this axiom plays in our reasoning seems to us to deserve attention)

and point out that while the second result fully agrees with our geometric intuition, its proof uses AC in an even more substantial way than the proof of the paradox. Thus Banach and Tarski imply that AC should not be rejected simply because it produces a paradoxical decomposition, for such an argument also undermines proofs of geometrically intuitive statements.
However, in 1949 A.P. Morse showed that the statement about Euclidean polygons can be proved in ZF set theory and thus does not require the axiom of choice. In 1964, Paul Cohen proved that the axiom of choice cannot be proved from ZF. A weaker version of an axiom of choice is the axiom of dependent choice, DC. It has been shown that

The Banach–Tarski paradox is not a theorem of ZF, nor of ZF+DC.[6]

Large amounts of mathematics use AC. As Stan Wagon points out at the end of his monograph, the Banach–Tarski paradox has been more significant for its role in pure mathematics than for foundational questions: it motivated a fruitful new direction for research, the amenability of groups, which has nothing to do with the foundational questions.
In 1991, using then-recent results by Matthew Foreman and Friedrich Wehrung,[7] Janusz Pawlikowski proved that the Banach–Tarski paradox follows from ZF plus the Hahn–Banach theorem.[8] The Hahn–Banach theorem doesn't rely on the full axiom of choice but can be proved using a weaker version of AC called the ultrafilter lemma. So Pawlikowski proved that the set theory needed to prove the Banach–Tarski paradox, while stronger than ZF, is weaker than full ZFC.
A sketch of the proof[edit]
Here we sketch a proof which is similar but not identical to that given by Banach and Tarski. Essentially, the paradoxical decomposition of the ball is achieved in four steps:

Find a paradoxical decomposition of the free group in two generators.
Find a group of rotations in 3-d space isomorphic to the free group in two generators.
Use the paradoxical decomposition of that group and the axiom of choice to produce a paradoxical decomposition of the hollow unit sphere.
Extend this decomposition of the sphere to a decomposition of the solid unit ball.

We now discuss each of these steps in more detail.
Step 1[edit]
The free group with two generators a and b consists of all finite strings that can be formed from the four symbols a, a−1, b and b−1 such that no a appears directly next to an a−1 and no b appears directly next to a b−1. Two such strings can be concatenated and converted into a string of this type by repeatedly replacing the "forbidden" substrings with the empty string. For instance: abab−1a−1 concatenated with abab−1a yields abab−1a−1abab−1a, which contains the substring a−1a, and so gets reduced to abab−1bab−1a, which contains the substring b−1b, which gets reduced to abaab−1a. One can check that the set of those strings with this operation forms a group with identity element the empty string e. We will call this group F2.




The sets S(a), S(a−1) and aS(a−1) in the Cayley graph of F2


The group  can be "paradoxically decomposed" as follows: let S(a) be the set of all non-forbidden strings that start with a and define S(a−1), S(b) and S(b−1) similarly. Clearly,



but also



and



where the notation aS(a−1) means take all the strings in S(a−1) and concatenate them on the left with a.
This is at the core of the proof. For example, there may be a string  in the set  which, because of the rule that  must not appear next to , reduces to the string . Similarly, it contains all the strings that start with  (for example the string  which reduces to ). In this way,  contains all the strings that start with ,  and .
We have cut our group F2 into four pieces (plus the singleton {e}), then "shifted" two of them by multiplying with a or b, then "reassembled" two pieces to make one copy of  and the other two to make another copy of . That is exactly what we want to do to the ball.
Step 2[edit]
In order to find a free group of rotations of 3D space, i.e. that behaves just like (or "is isomorphic to") the free group F2, we take two orthogonal axes, e.g. the x and z axes, and let A be a rotation of  about the first, x axis, and B be a rotation of  about the z axis (there are many other suitable pairs of irrational multiples of π, that could be used here as well).[9]
The group of rotations generated by A and B will be called H. Let  be an element of H which starts with a rotation on the z axis, of the form .
It can be shown by induction that  maps the point  to , for some . Analysing  and  modulo 3, one can show that . The same argument repeated (by symmetry of the problem) is valid for the opposite rotation about the z axis, as well as rotations about the x axis. This shows that for any non trivial word  H, then . Therefore, the group H is a free group, isomorphic to F2.
The two rotations behave just like the elements a and b in the group F2: we now have a paradoxical decomposition of H.
This step cannot be performed in two dimensions since it involves rotations in three dimensions. If we take two rotations about the same axis, the resulting group is commutative and doesn't have the property required in step 1.
An alternate arithmetic proof of the existence of free groups in some special orthogonal groups using integral quaternions leads to paradoxical decompositions of the rotation group.[10]
Step 3[edit]
The unit sphere S2 is partitioned into orbits by the action of our group H: two points belong to the same orbit if and only if there's a rotation in H which moves the first point into the second. (Note that the orbit of a point is a dense set in S2.) We can use the axiom of choice to pick exactly one point from every orbit; collect these points into a set M. Now (almost) every point in S2 can be reached in exactly one way by applying the proper rotation from H to the proper element from M, and because of this, the paradoxical decomposition of H then yields a paradoxical decomposition of S2 into four pieces A1, A2, A3, A4 as follows:






where we use the notation



and likewise for the other sets and define



(We didn't use the five "paradoxical" parts of F2 directly, as they would leave us with M as an extra piece after doubling, owing to the presence of the singleton {e}!)
The (majority of the) sphere has now been divided into four sets (each one dense on the sphere), and when two of these are rotated, we end up with double what we had before:




Step 4[edit]
Finally, connect every point on S2 with a ray to the origin; the paradoxical decomposition of S2 then yields a paradoxical decomposition of the solid unit ball minus the point at the ball's centre (this center point needs a bit more care, see below).
N.B. This sketch glosses over some details. One has to be careful about the set of points on the sphere which happen to lie on the axis of some rotation in H. However, there are only countably many such points, and like the point at the centre of the ball, it is possible to patch the proof to account for them all (see below).
Some details, fleshed out[edit]
In Step 3, we partitioned the sphere into orbits of our group H. To streamline the proof, we omitted the discussion of points that are fixed by some rotation; since the paradoxical decomposition of F2 relies on shifting certain subsets, the fact that some points are fixed might cause some trouble. Since any rotation of S2 (other than the null rotation) has exactly two fixed points, and since H, which is isomorphic to F2, is countable, there are countably many points of S2 that are fixed by some rotation in H, denote this set of fixed points D. Step 3 proves that S2 − D admits a paradoxical decomposition.
What remains to be shown is the Claim: S2 − D is equidecomposable with S2.
Proof. Let λ be some line through the origin that does not intersect any point in D – this is possible since D is countable. Let J be the set of angles, α, such that for some natural number n, and some P in D, r(nα)P is also in D, where r(nα) is a rotation about λ of nα. Then J is countable so there exists an angle θ not in J. Let ρ be the rotation about λ by θ, then ρ acts on S2 with no fixed points in D, i.e., ρn(D) is disjoint from D, and for natural m&lt;n, ρn(D) is disjoint from ρm(D). Let E be the disjoint union of ρn(D) over n = 0, 1, 2, .... Then S2 = E ∪ (S2 − E) ~ ρ(E) ∪ (S2 − E) = (E − D) ∪ (S2 − E) = S2 − D, where ~ denotes "is equidecomposable to".
For step 4, it has already been shown that the ball minus a point admits a paradoxical decomposition; it remains to be shown that the ball minus a point is equidecomposable with the ball. Consider a circle within the ball, containing the point at the centre of the ball. Using an argument like that used to prove the Claim, one can see that the full circle is equidecomposable with the circle minus the point at the ball's centre. (Basically, a countable set of points on the circle can be rotated to give itself plus one more point.) Note that this involves the rotation about a point other than the origin, so the Banach–Tarski paradox involves isometries of Euclidean 3-space rather than just SO(3).
We are using the fact that if A ~ B and B ~ C, then A ~ C. The decomposition of A into C can be done using number of pieces equal to the product of the numbers needed for taking A into B and for taking B into C.
The proof sketched above requires 2 × 4 × 2&#160;+&#160;8&#160;=&#160;24 pieces, a factor of 2 to remove fixed points, a factor 4 from step 1, a factor 2 to recreate fixed points, and 8 for the center point of the second ball. But in step 1 when moving {e} and all strings of the form an into S(a−1), do this to all orbits except one. Move {e} of this last orbit to the center point of the second ball. This brings the total down to 16&#160;+&#160;1 pieces. With more algebra one can also decompose fixed orbits into 4 sets as in step 1. This gives 5 pieces and is the best possible.
Obtaining infinitely many balls from one[edit]
Using the Banach–Tarski paradox, it is possible to obtain k copies of a ball in the Euclidean n-space from one, for any integers n ≥ 3 and k ≥ 1, i.e. a ball can be cut into k pieces so that each of them is equidecomposable to a ball of the same size as the original. Using the fact that the free group F2 of rank 2 admits a free subgroup of countably infinite rank, a similar proof yields that the unit sphere Sn−1 can be partitioned into countably infinitely many pieces, each of which is equidecomposable (with two pieces) to the Sn−1 using rotations. By using analytic properties of the rotation group SO(n), which is a connected analytic Lie group, one can further prove that the sphere Sn−1 can be partitioned into as many pieces as there are real numbers (that is,  pieces), so that each piece is equidecomposable with two pieces to Sn−1 using rotations. These results then extend to the unit ball deprived of the origin. A 2010 article by Valeriy Churkin gives a new proof of the continuous version of the Banach–Tarski paradox.[11]
The von Neumann paradox in the Euclidean plane[edit]
Main article: von Neumann paradox
In the Euclidean plane, two figures that are equidecomposable with respect to the group of Euclidean motions are necessarily of the same area, therefore, a paradoxical decomposition of a square or disk of Banach–Tarski type that uses only Euclidean congruences is impossible. A conceptual explanation of the distinction between the planar and higher-dimensional cases was given by John von Neumann: unlike the group SO(3) of rotations in three dimensions, the group E(2) of Euclidean motions of the plane is solvable, which implies the existence of a finitely-additive measure on E(2) and R2 which is invariant under translations and rotations, and rules out paradoxical decompositions of non-negligible sets. Von Neumann then posed the following question: can such a paradoxical decomposition be constructed if one allowed a larger group of equivalences?
It is clear that if one permits similarities, any two squares in the plane become equivalent even without further subdivision. This motivates restricting one's attention to the group SA2 of area-preserving affine transformations. Since the area is preserved, any paradoxical decomposition of a square with respect to this group would be counterintuitive for the same reasons as the Banach–Tarski decomposition of a ball. In fact, the group SA2 contains as a subgroup the special linear group SL(2,R), which in its turn contains the free group F2 with two generators as a subgroup. This makes it plausible that the proof of Banach–Tarski paradox can be imitated in the plane. The main difficulty here lies in the fact that the unit square is not invariant under the action of the linear group SL(2, R), hence one cannot simply transfer a paradoxical decomposition from the group to the square, as in the third step of the above proof of the Banach–Tarski paradox. Moreover, the fixed points of the group present difficulties (for example, the origin is fixed under all linear transformations). This is why von Neumann used the larger group SA2 including the translations, and he constructed a paradoxical decomposition of the unit square with respect to the enlarged group (in 1929). Applying the Banach–Tarski method, the paradox for the square can be strengthened as follows:

Any two bounded subsets of the Euclidean plane with non-empty interiors are equidecomposable with respect to the area-preserving affine maps.

As von Neumann notes,[12]

"Infolgedessen gibt es bereits in der Ebene kein nichtnegatives additives Maß (wo das Einheitsquadrat das Maß 1 hat), das gegenüber allen Abbildungen von A2 invariant wäre."


"In accordance with this, already in the plane there is no nonnegative additive measure (for which the unit square has a measure of 1), which is invariant with respect to all transformations belonging to A2 [the group of area-preserving affine transformations]."

To explain this a bit more, the question of whether a finitely additive measure exists, that is preserved under certain transformations, depends on what transformations are allowed. The Banach measure of sets in the plane, which is preserved by translations and rotations, is not preserved by non-isometric transformations even when they do preserve the area of polygons. The points of the plane (other than the origin) can be divided into two dense sets which we may call A and B. If the A points of a given polygon are transformed by a certain area-preserving transformation and the B points by another, both sets can become subsets of the A points in two new polygons. The new polygons have the same area as the old polygon, but the two transformed sets cannot have the same measure as before (since they contain only part of the A points), and therefore there is no measure that "works".
The class of groups isolated by von Neumann in the course of study of Banach–Tarski phenomenon turned out to be very important for many areas of mathematics: these are amenable groups, or groups with an invariant mean, and include all finite and all solvable groups. Generally speaking, paradoxical decompositions arise when the group used for equivalences in the definition of equidecomposability is not amenable.
Recent progress[edit]

2000. Von Neumann's paper left open the possibility of a paradoxical decomposition of the interior of the unit square with respect to the linear group SL(2,R) (Wagon, Question 7.4). In 2000, Miklós Laczkovich proved that such a decomposition exists.[13] More precisely, let A be the family of all bounded subsets of the plane with non-empty interior and at a positive distance from the origin, and B the family of all planar sets with the property that a union of finitely many translates under some elements of SL(2, R) contains a punctured neighbourhood of the origin. Then all sets in the family A are SL(2, R)-equidecomposable, and likewise for the sets in B. It follows that both families consist of paradoxical sets.
2003. It had been known for a long time that the full plane was paradoxical with respect to SA2, and that the minimal number of pieces would equal four provided that there exists a locally commutative free subgroup of SA2. In 2003 Kenzi Satô constructed such a subgroup, confirming that four pieces suffice.[14]

The VLS cells on board USS&#160;San Jacinto

A vertical launching system (VLS) is an advanced system for holding and firing missiles on mobile naval platforms, such as surface ships and submarines. Each vertical launch system consists of a number of cells, which can hold one or more missiles ready for firing. Typically, each cell can hold a number of different types of missiles, allowing the ship flexibility to load the best set for any given mission. Further, when new missiles are developed, they are typically fitted to the existing vertical launch systems of that nation, allowing existing ships to use new types of missiles without expensive rework. When the command is given, the missile flies straight up long enough to clear the cell and the ship, and then turns on course.
A VLS allows surface combatants to have a greater number of weapons ready for firing at any given time compared to older launching systems such as the Mark 13 single-arm and Mark 26 twin-arm launchers, which were fed from behind by a magazine below the main deck. In addition to greater firepower, VLS is much more damage tolerant and reliable than the previous systems, and has a lower radar cross-section (RCS). The U.S. Navy now relies exclusively on VLS for its guided missile destroyers and cruisers.
The most widespread vertical launch system in the world is the Mark 41, developed by the US Navy. More than 11,000 Mark 41 VLS missile cells have been delivered, or are on order, for use on 186 ships across 19 ship classes, in 11 navies around the world. This system currently serves with the US Navy as well as the Australian, Canadian, Danish, Dutch, German, Japanese, New Zealand, Norwegian, South Korean, Spanish, and Turkish navies, while others like the Greek Navy preferred the similar Mark 48 system.[1]
The advanced Mark 57 vertical launch system is projected to be used on the new Zumwalt-class destroyer. The older Mark 13 and Mark 26 systems remain in service on ships that were sold to other countries such as Taiwan and Poland.
When installed on an SSN (nuclear-powered attack submarine), a VLS allows a greater number and variety of weapons to be deployed in comparison to using only torpedo tubes.

Hot launch and cold launch[edit]




Diagram depicting a hot launch from a Mark 41 VLS


A vertical launch system can be either hot launch, where the missile ignites in the cell, or cold launch, where the missile is expelled by gas produced by a gas generator which is not part of the missile itself, and then the missile ignites. "Cold" means relatively cold compared with rocket engine exhaust. A hot launch system does not require an ejection mechanism, but does require some way of disposing of the missile's exhaust and heat as it leaves the cell. If the missile ignites in a cell without an ejection mechanism, the cell must withstand the tremendous heat generated without igniting the missiles in the adjacent cells.




US Navy Mark 41 Tomahawk launch, hot launch.


An advantage of a hot-launch system is that the missile propels itself out of the launching cell using its own engine, which eliminates the need for a separate system to eject the missile from the launching tube. This potentially makes a hot-launch system relatively light, small, and economical to develop and produce, particularly when designed around smaller missiles. A potential disadvantage is that a malfunctioning missile could destroy the launch tube.
The advantage of the cold-launch system is in its safety: should a missile engine malfunction during launch, the cold-launch system can eject the missile thereby reducing or eliminating the threat. For this reason, Russian VLSs are often designed with a slant so that a malfunctioning missile will land in the water instead of on the ship's deck. As missile size grows, the benefits of ejection launching increase. Above a certain size, a missile booster cannot be safely ignited within the confines of a ship's hull. Most modern ICBMs and SLBMs are cold-launched.
American surface-ship VLSs have the missile cells arranged in a grid with one lid per cell and are "hot launch" systems; the engine ignites within the cell during the launch, and thus it requires exhaust piping for the missile flames and gasses. France, Italy and Britain use a similar hot-launching Sylver system in PAAMS. Russia produces both grid systems and a revolver design with more than one missile per lid. Russia also uses a cold launch system for some of its vertical launch missile systems, e.g., the Tor missile system. The People's Republic of China uses a circular "cold launch" system that ejects the missile from the launch tube before igniting the engine on the Type 052C destroyer, and also a rectangular ”hot launch" system with one lid per cell arranged in a grid on the Type 054A frigate.

			Electric utility
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				An electric utility is an electric power company (often a public utility) that engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity for sale generally in a regulated market.[1] The electrical utility industry is a major provider of energy in most countries. It is indispensable to factories, commercial establishments, homes, and even most recreational facilities. Lack of electricity causes not only inconvenience, but also economic loss due to reduced industrial production.
Electric utilities include investor owned, publicly owned, cooperatives, and nationalized entities. They may be engaged in all or only some aspects of the industry. Electricity markets are also considered electric utilities--these entities buy and sell electricity, acting as brokers, but usually do not own or operate generation, transmission, or distribution facilities. Utilities are regulated by local and national authorities.
Electric utilities are facing increasing demands [2] according to Black &amp; Veatch's annual utility survey, based on input from 700 utility participants, for 2011 the top-three concerns were aging infrastructure, reliability (no. 1 in 2010) and regulation (no. 2 in 2010).

Organization[edit]
Utility service territories are typically geographically distinct from one another. These territories may be set by regulation or by economics as the capital cost of reproducing infrastructure is usually prohibitive. Each territory is composed of different types of consumers, usually broadly described as either commercial, residential or industrial.
Tariff structure[edit]
Electricity consumers are divided into classes of service or sectors (residential, commercial, industrial, and other) based on the type of service they receive. Sectoral classification of consumers is determined by each utility and is based on various criteria such as:[citation needed]

demand levels
rate schedules
distribution voltage
accounting methods
end-use applications
other social and economic characteristics

Utilities typically employ a number of tariffs. The alternative tariffs reflect consumers' varying consumption levels and patterns and the associated impact on the utility's costs of providing the service.
Power transactions[edit]
An electric power system is a group of generation, transmission, distribution, communication, and other facilities that are physically connected.[3] The flow of electricity with the system is maintained and controlled by dispatch centers. It is the responsibility of the dispatch center to match the supply of electricity with the demand. In order to carry out its responsibilities, the dispatch center is authorized to buy and sell electricity based on system requirements. The interconnected utilities within each power grid coordinate operations and may buy and sell power among themselves. The bulk power system makes it possible for utilities to engage in wholesale (for resale) electric power trade. Wholesale trade has historically played an important role, allowing utilities to reduce power costs, increase power supply options, and improve reliability. Authority for those transactions has been pre-approved under interconnection agreements signed by all the electric utilities physically interconnected or with coordination agreements among utilities that are not connected.
Executive compensation[edit]
The compensation received by the executive in utility companies often receives the most scrutiny in the review of operating expenses. Just as regulated utilities and their governing bodies struggle to maintain a balance between keeping consumer costs reasonable and being profitable enough to attract investors, they must also compete with private companies for talented executives and then be able to retain those executives.[4]
Constraints from regulation have been shown to affect the level of compensation received by executives in electric utilities. Executive compensation usually consists of four parts:[5] # Base salary

Short term incentive pay (STIP)
Long-term incentive pay (LTIP); and
Benefits such as retirement and health care

Regulated companies are less likely to use incentive-based compensation in addition to base salaries. Executives in regulated electric utilities are less likely to be paid for their performance in bonuses or stock options.[6]
Executive compensation[edit]
Executives in regulated electric utilities also have less managerial control than those in unregulated or private industries. These executives are in charge of large numbers of workers as well as the company’s physical and financial assets. Limiting their control has been shown to reduce investment opportunities. The same constraints are placed on the board of directors for the utility by the monitoring or oversight of the utility commission and they are less likely to approve compensation policies that include incentive-based pay.[7] The compensation for electric utility executives will be the lowest in regulated utilities that have an unfavorable regulatory environment. These companies have more political constraints than those in a favorable regulatory environment and are less likely to have a positive response to requests for rate increases.[8]
Just as increased constraints from regulation drive compensation down for executives in electric utilities, deregulation has been shown to increase compensation. The need to encourage risk-taking behavior in seeking new investment opportunities while keeping costs under control requires deregulated companies to offer performance-based incentives to their executives. It has been found that increased compensation is also more likely to attract executives experienced in working in competitive environments.[9]
The Energy Act of 1992 removed previous barriers to wholesale competition in the electric utility industry. Currently twenty-four states allow for deregulated electric utilities: Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Virginia, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, and Washington D.C.[10] As electric utility monopolies have been increasingly broken up into deregulated businesses, executive compensation has risen; particularly incentive compensation.[11]

			Natural number
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				This article is about “positive integers” and “non-negative integers”.  For all the numbers …, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …, see Integer.




Natural numbers can be used for counting (one apple, two apples, three apples, …)


In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting (as in "there are six coins on the table") and ordering (as in "this is the third largest city in the country"). In common language, words used for counting are "cardinal numbers" and words used for ordering are "ordinal numbers".
Some authors begin the natural numbers with 0, corresponding to the non-negative integers 0, 1, 2, 3, …, whereas others start with 1, corresponding to the positive integers 1, 2, 3, ….[1][2][3][4] Texts that exclude zero from the natural numbers sometimes refer to the natural numbers together with zero as the whole numbers, but in other writings, that term is used instead for the integers (including negative integers).
The natural numbers are the basis from which many other number sets may be built by extension: the integers, by including an additive inverse (-n) for each natural number n (and zero, if it is not there already, as its own additive inverse); the rational numbers, by including a multiplicative inverse (1/n) for each integer number n; the real numbers by including with the rationals the (converging) Cauchy sequences of rationals; the complex numbers, by including with the real numbers the unresolved square root of minus one; and so on.[5][6] These chains of extensions make the natural numbers canonically embedded (identified) in the other number systems.
Properties of the natural numbers, such as divisibility and the distribution of prime numbers, are studied in number theory. Problems concerning counting and ordering, such as partitioning and enumerations, are studied in combinatorics.
In common language, for example in primary school, natural numbers may be called counting numbers[7] to contrast the discreteness of counting to the continuity of measurement, established by the real numbers.
The natural numbers can, at times, appear as a convenient set of names (labels), that is, as what linguists call nominal numbers, foregoing many or all of the properties of being a number in a mathematical sense.

History
Ancient roots




The Ishango bone (on exhibition at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences)[8][9][10] is believed to have been used 20,000 years ago for natural number arithmetic.


The most primitive method of representing a natural number is to put down a mark for each object. Later, a set of objects could be tested for equality, excess or shortage, by striking out a mark and removing an object from the set.
The first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers. This allowed systems to be developed for recording large numbers. The ancient Egyptians developed a powerful system of numerals with distinct hieroglyphs for&#160;1, 10, and all the powers of&#160;10 up to over 1&#160;million. A stone carving from Karnak, dating from around 1500&#160;BC and now at the Louvre in Paris, depicts&#160;276 as 2&#160;hundreds, 7&#160;tens, and 6&#160;ones; and similarly for the number&#160;4,622. The Babylonians had a place-value system based essentially on the numerals for&#160;1 and&#160;10, using base sixty, so that the symbol for sixty was the same as the symbol for one, its value being determined from context.[11]
A much later advance was the development of the idea that&#160;0 can be considered as a number, with its own numeral. The use of a&#160;0 digit in place-value notation (within other numbers) dates back as early as 700&#160;BC by the Babylonians, but they omitted such a digit when it would have been the last symbol in the number.[12] The Olmec and Maya civilizations used&#160;0 as a separate number as early as the 1st century BC, but this usage did not spread beyond Mesoamerica.[13][14] The use of a numeral&#160;0 in modern times originated with the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in 628. However, 0 had been used as a number in the medieval computus (the calculation of the date of Easter), beginning with Dionysius Exiguus in 525, without being denoted by a numeral (standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for&#160;0); instead nulla (or the genitive form nullae) from nullus, the Latin word for "none", was employed to denote a&#160;0 value.[15]
The first systematic study of numbers as abstractions is usually credited to the Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Archimedes. Some Greek mathematicians treated the number&#160;1 differently than larger numbers, sometimes even not as a number at all.[16]
Independent studies also occurred at around the same time in India, China, and Mesoamerica.[17]

In 19th century Europe, there was mathematical and philosophical discussion about the exact nature of the natural numbers. A school of Naturalism stated that the natural numbers were a direct consequence of the human psyche. Henri Poincaré was one of its advocates, as was Leopold Kronecker who summarized "God made the integers, all else is the work of man".
In opposition to the Naturalists, the constructivists saw a need to improve the logical rigor in the foundations of mathematics.[18] In the 1860s, Hermann Grassmann suggested a recursive definition for natural numbers thus stating they were not really natural but a consequence of definitions. Later, two classes of such formal definitions were constructed; later, they were shown to be equivalent in most practical applications.
Set-theoretical definitions of natural numbers were initiated by Frege and he initially defined a natural number as the class of all sets that are in one-to-one correspondence with a particular set, but this definition turned out to lead to paradoxes including Russell's paradox. Therefore, this formalism was modified so that a natural number is defined as a particular set, and any set that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with that set is said to have that number of elements.[19]
The second class of definitions was introduced by Giuseppe Peano and is now called Peano arithmetic. It is based on an axiomatization of the properties of ordinal numbers: each natural number has a successor and every non-zero natural number has a unique predecessor. Peano arithmetic is equiconsistent with several weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Theorems that can be proved in ZFC but cannot be proved using the Peano Axioms include Goodstein's theorem.[20]
With all these definitions it is convenient to include&#160;0 (corresponding to the empty set) as a natural number. Including&#160;0 is now the common convention among set theorists[21] and logicians.[22] Other mathematicians also include&#160;0[4] although many have kept the older tradition and take&#160;1 to be the first natural number.[23] Computer scientists often start from zero when enumerating items like loop counters and string- or array- elements.[24][25]
Notation




The double-struck capital N symbol, often used to denote the set of all natural numbers (see List of mathematical symbols).


Mathematicians use N or ℕ (an N in blackboard bold) to refer to the set of all natural numbers. This set is countably infinite: it is infinite but countable by definition. This is also expressed by saying that the cardinal number of the set is aleph-naught ℵ0.[26]
To be unambiguous about whether 0 is included or not, sometimes an index (or superscript) "0" is added in the former case, and a superscript "*" or subscript "1" is added in the latter case:[citation needed]

ℕ0 = ℕ0 = {0, 1, 2, …}
ℕ* = ℕ+ = ℕ1 = ℕ&gt;0 = {1, 2, …}.

Properties
Addition
One can recursively define an addition on the natural numbers by setting a + 0 = a and a + S(b) = S(a + b) for all a, b. Here S should be read as "successor". This turns the natural numbers (ℕ, +) into a commutative monoid with identity element&#160;0, the so-called free object with one generator. This monoid satisfies the cancellation property and can be embedded in a group (in the mathematical sense of the word group). The smallest group containing the natural numbers is the integers.
If 1 is defined as S(0), then b + 1 = b + S(0) = S(b + 0) = S(b). That is, b + 1 is simply the successor of b.
Multiplication
Analogously, given that addition has been defined, a multiplication × can be defined via a × 0 = 0 and a × S(b) = (a × b) + a. This turns (ℕ*, ×) into a free commutative monoid with identity element&#160;1; a generator set for this monoid is the set of prime numbers.
Relationship between addition and multiplication
Addition and multiplication are compatible, which is expressed in the distribution law: a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c). These properties of addition and multiplication make the natural numbers an instance of a commutative semiring. Semirings are an algebraic generalization of the natural numbers where multiplication is not necessarily commutative. The lack of additive inverses, which is equivalent to the fact that ℕ is not closed under subtraction, means that ℕ is not a ring; instead it is a semiring (also known as a rig).
If the natural numbers are taken as "excluding 0", and "starting at 1", the definitions of + and × are as above, except that they begin with a + 1 = S(a) and a × 1 = a.
Order
In this section, juxtaposed variables such as ab indicate the product a × b, and the standard order of operations is assumed.
A total order on the natural numbers is defined by letting a ≤ b if and only if there exists another natural number c with a + c = b. This order is compatible with the arithmetical operations in the following sense: if a, b and c are natural numbers and a ≤ b, then a + c ≤ b + c and ac ≤ bc. An important property of the natural numbers is that they are well-ordered: every non-empty set of natural numbers has a least element. The rank among well-ordered sets is expressed by an ordinal number; for the natural numbers this is expressed as ω.
Division
In this section, juxtaposed variables such as ab indicate the product a × b, and the standard order of operations is assumed.
While it is in general not possible to divide one natural number by another and get a natural number as result, the procedure of division with remainder is available as a substitute: for any two natural numbers a and b with b ≠ 0 there are natural numbers q and r such that

a = bq + r and r &lt; b.

The number q is called the quotient and r is called the remainder of division of a by&#160;b. The numbers q and r are uniquely determined by a and&#160;b. This Euclidean division is key to several other properties (divisibility), algorithms (such as the Euclidean algorithm), and ideas in number theory.
Algebraic properties satisfied by the natural numbers
The addition (+) and multiplication (×) operations on natural numbers as defined above have several algebraic properties:

Closure under addition and multiplication: for all natural numbers a and b, both a + b and a × b are natural numbers.
Associativity: for all natural numbers a, b, and c, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a × (b × c) = (a × b) × c.
Commutativity: for all natural numbers a and b, a + b = b + a and a × b = b × a.
Existence of identity elements: for every natural number a, a + 0 = a and a × 1 = a.
Distributivity of multiplication over addition for all natural numbers a, b, and c, a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c).
No nonzero zero divisors: if a and b are natural numbers such that a × b = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0.

Generalizations
Two generalizations of natural numbers arise from the two uses:

A natural number can be used to express the size of a finite set; more generally a cardinal number is a measure for the size of a set also suitable for infinite sets; this refers to a concept of "size" such that if there is a bijection between two sets they have the same size. The set of natural numbers itself and any other countably infinite set has cardinality aleph-null (ℵ0).
Linguistic ordinal numbers "first", "second", "third" can be assigned to the elements of a totally ordered finite set, and also to the elements of well-ordered countably infinite sets like the set of natural numbers itself. This can be generalized to ordinal numbers which describe the position of an element in a well-ordered set in general. An ordinal number is also used to describe the "size" of a well-ordered set, in a sense different from cardinality: if there is an order isomorphism between two well-ordered sets they have the same ordinal number. The first ordinal number that is not a natural number is expressed as ω; this is also the ordinal number of the set of natural numbers itself.

Many well-ordered sets with cardinal number ℵ0 have an ordinal number greater than ω (the latter is the lowest possible). The least ordinal of cardinality ℵ0 (i.e., the initial ordinal) is ω.
For finite well-ordered sets, there is one-to-one correspondence between ordinal and cardinal numbers; therefore they can both be expressed by the same natural number, the number of elements of the set. This number can also be used to describe the position of an element in a larger finite, or an infinite, sequence.
A countable non-standard model of arithmetic satisfying the Peano Arithmetic (i.e., the first-order Peano axioms) was developed by Skolem in 1933. The hypernatural numbers are an uncountable model that can be constructed from the ordinary natural numbers via the ultrapower construction.
Georges Reeb used to claim provocatively that The naïve integers don't fill up ℕ. Other generalizations are discussed in the article on numbers.
Formal definitions
Peano axioms
Main article: Peano axioms
Many properties of the natural numbers can be derived from the Peano axioms.[27][28]

Axiom One: 0 is a natural number.
Axiom Two: Every natural number has a successor.
Axiom Three: 0 is not the successor of any natural number.
Axiom Four: If the successor of x equals the successor of y, then x equals y.
Axiom Five (the Axiom of Induction): If a statement is true of 0, and if the truth of that statement for a number implies its truth for the successor of that number, then the statement is true for every natural number.

These are not the original axioms published by Peano, but are named in his honor. Some forms of the Peano axioms have 1 in place of 0. In ordinary arithmetic, the successor of x is x + 1. Replacing Axiom Five by an axiom schema one obtains a (weaker) first-order theory called Peano Arithmetic.
Constructions based on set theory
Main article: Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers
von Neumann construction
In the area of mathematics called set theory, a special case of the von Neumann ordinal construction [29] defines the natural numbers as follows:

Set 0 = { }, the empty set,
Define S(a) = a ∪ {a} for every set a. S(a) is the successor of a, and S is called the successor function.
By the axiom of infinity, there exists a set which contains 0 and is closed under the successor function. Such sets are said to be 'inductive'. The intersection of all such inductive sets is defined to be the set of natural numbers. It can be checked that the set of natural numbers satisfies the Peano axioms.
It follows that each natural number is equal to the set of all natural numbers less than it:




0 = { },
1 = 0 ∪ {0} = {0} = {{ }},
2 = 1 ∪ {1} = {0, 1} = {{ }, {{ }}},
3 = 2 ∪ {2} = {0, 1, 2} = {{ }, {{ }}, {{ }, {{ }}}},
n = n−1 ∪ {n−1} = {0, 1, …, n−1} = {{ }, {{ }}, …, {{ }, {{ }}, …}}, etc.



With this definition, a natural number n is a particular set with n elements, and n ≤ m if and only if n is a subset of m.
Also, with this definition, different possible interpretations of notations like ℝn (n-tuples versus mappings of n into ℝ) coincide.
Even if one does not accept the axiom of infinity and therefore cannot accept that the set of all natural numbers exists, it is still possible to define any one of these sets.
Other constructions
Although the standard construction is useful, it is not the only possible construction. Zermelo's construction goes as follows:

Set 0 = { }
Define S(a) = {a},
It then follows that




0 = { },
1 = {0} = {{ }},
2 = {1} = {{{ }}},
n = {n−1} = {{{…}}}, etc.


Each natural number is then equal to the set of the natural number preceding it.

"Autobahn" is a song by German electronic band Kraftwerk, composed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider of the band, with Emil Schult collaborating on the lyrics. It is co-produced by Conny Plank, and was the band's first track to use sung lyrics. Recorded in 1974, the song is designed to capture the feel of driving on a motorway.

Lyrics[edit]
The lyrics of the song are in German, the main refrain being "Wir fahren fahren fahren auf der Autobahn" (English: "We drive drive drive on the Autobahn"). The chorus was often mistaken for the English phrase "Fun fun fun on the Autobahn" and thought to be a reference to the 1964 Beach Boys' song "Fun, Fun, Fun". Band member Wolfgang Flür later commented:

No! Someone else told me that they [the misinterpreters] thought the way we speak in German, 'Fahren,' which means driving, sounds like the English word, 'fun.' 'Fahren fahren fahren,' 'fun fun fun.' That is wrong. But it works. Driving is fun. We had no speed limit on the autobahn, we could race through the highways, through the Alps, so yes, fahren fahren fahren, fun fun fun. But it wasn't anything to do with the Beach Boys! We used to drive a lot, we used to listen to the sound of driving, the wind, passing cars and lorries, the rain, every moment the sounds around you are changing, and the idea was to rebuild those sounds on the synth.[1]

Ralf Hütter has said that The Beach Boys were an influence on the band, and seemed[to whom?] more open to the interpretation of the chorus as a homage to their song.
Unlike many of the band's most popular songs, the band has never released "Autobahn" in any other language.
Composition[edit]
The instrumentation used on the song's 1974 recording was highly innovative at the time and is notable for the significant influence it had on many subsequent genres of electronic popular and dance music. Notable aspects of the arrangement included:

Electronic percussion pads, played by Wolfgang Flür.
Use of a classic 'Moog bass' sound to play the bass line, playing an octave riff with added analogue echo.
Liberal use of phasing on synths to play the chords.
Use of a vocoder to process some of the vocals.
Use of the so-called 'motorik' 4/4 drum beat in the song's final section.

The arrangement also included acoustic elements such as guitar and flute.
The band have continued to perform the song live regularly throughout their career. Live arrangements have evolved continuously as the band have adapted the instrumentation and equipment they use on stage.
Release[edit]
A version of the song lasting over 22 minutes was recorded as the title track of the album Autobahn. This was edited to a more modest 3 minute and 28 seconds running time and released as a single, giving the band an unexpected Top 40 hit in the USA, and other countries, the first of their career. A differently edited version, at 3 minutes and 5 seconds duration, was released in the UK, reaching #11, and was later included on the UK compilation LP Exceller 8. The song also reached #12 in Canada (Vertigo VE-203) and number 12 in the Netherlands.

History[edit]




Werner von Siemens


1847 to 1901[edit]
Siemens &amp; Halske was founded by Werner von Siemens and Johann Georg Halske on 12 October 1847. Based on the telegraph, his invention used a needle to point to the sequence of letters, instead of using Morse code. The company, then called Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens &amp; Halske, opened its first workshop on October 12.[4]
In 1848, the company built the first long-distance telegraph line in Europe; 500&#160;km from Berlin to Frankfurt am Main. In 1850, the founder's younger brother, Carl Wilhelm Siemens later Sir William Siemens started to represent the company in London. The London agency became a branch office in 1858. In the 1850s, the company was involved in building long distance telegraph networks in Russia. In 1855, a company branch headed by another brother, Carl Heinrich von Siemens, opened in St Petersburg, Russia. In 1867, Siemens completed the monumental Indo-European (Calcutta to London) telegraph line.[5]
In 1867, Werner von Siemens described a dynamo without permanent magnets (independently invented also by Charles Wheatstone), and Siemens became the first company to build such devices.
In 1881, a Siemens AC Alternator driven by a watermill was used to power the world's first electric street lighting in the town of Godalming, United Kingdom. The company continued to grow and diversified into electric trains and light bulbs. In 1890, the founder retired and left running the company to his brother Carl and sons Arnold and Wilhelm. In 1887 it opened its first office in Japan.[6]
1901 to 1933[edit]
Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) was incorporated in 1897, and then merged parts of its activities with Schuckert &amp; Co., Nuremberg in 1903 to become Siemens-Schuckert.
In 1907, Siemens (Siemens &amp; Halske and Siemens-Schuckert) had 34,324 employees and was the seventh-largest company in the German empire by number of employees.[7] (see List of German companies by employees in 1907)
In 1919, S &amp; H and two other companies jointly formed the Osram lightbulb company.
During the 1920s and 1930s, S &amp; H started to manufacture radios, television sets, and electron microscopes.
In 1932, Reiniger, Gebbert &amp; Schall (Erlangen), Phönix AG (Rudolstadt) and Siemens-Reiniger-Veifa mbH (Berlin) merged to form the Siemens-Reiniger-Werke AG (SRW), the third of the so-called parent companies that merged in 1966 to form the present-day Siemens AG.[8]
In the 1920s, Siemens constructed the Ardnacrusha Hydro Power station on the River Shannon in the then Irish Free State, and it was a world first for its design. The company is remembered for its desire to raise the wages of its under-paid workers only to be overruled by the Cumann na nGaedheal government.[9]
1933 to 1945[edit]

Siemens (at the time: Siemens-Schuckert) employed some skilled labor among deported people in extermination camps. The company owned a plant in Auschwitz concentration camp.[10][11]
During the final years of World War II, numerous plants and factories in Berlin and other major cities were destroyed by Allied air raids. To prevent further losses, manufacturing was therefore moved to alternative places and regions not affected by the air war. The goal was to secure continued production of important war-related and everyday goods. According to records, Siemens was operating almost 400 alternative or relocated manufacturing plants at the end of 1944 and in early 1945.
In 1972, Siemens sued German satirist F.C. Delius for his satirical history of the company, Unsere Siemenswelt, and it was determined much of the book contained false claims although the trial itself publicized Siemens' history in Nazi Germany.[12] The company supplied electrical parts to Nazi concentration camps and death camps. The factories had poor working conditions, where malnutrition and death were common. Also, the scholarship has shown that the camp factories were created, run, and supplied by the SS, in conjunction with company officials, sometimes high-level officials.[13][14][15][16]
Siemens businessman and Nazi Party member John Rabe is, however, credited with saving many Chinese lives during the infamous Nanking Massacre. He later toured Germany lecturing on the atrocities committed by Japanese forces in Nanking.[17]
1945 to 2001[edit]

In the 1950s and from their new base in Bavaria, S&amp;H started to manufacture computers, semiconductor devices, washing machines, and pacemakers.
In 1966, Siemens &amp; Halske (S&amp;H, founded in 1847), Siemens-Schuckertwerke (SSW, founded in 1903) and Siemens-Reiniger-Werke (SRW, founded in 1932) merged to form Siemens AG.[8]
In 1969, Siemens formed Kraftwerk Union with AEG by pooling their nuclear power businesses.[18]
The company's first digital telephone exchange was produced in 1980. In 1988 Siemens and GEC acquired the UK defence and technology company Plessey. Plessey's holdings were split, and Siemens took over the avionics, radar and traffic control businesses — as Siemens Plessey.
In 1985, Siemens bought Allis-Chalmers' interest in the partnership company Siemens-Allis (formed 1978) which supplied electrical control equipment. It was incorporated into Siemens' Energy and Automation division.[19]
In 1987, Siemens reintegrated Kraftwerk Union, the unit overseeing nuclear power business.[18]
In 1991, Siemens acquired Nixdorf Computer AG and renamed it Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG, in order to produce personal computers.
In October 1991, Siemens acquired the Industrial Systems Division of Texas Instruments, Inc, based in Johnson City, Tennessee. This division was organized as Siemens Industrial Automation, Inc., and was later absorbed by Siemens Energy and Automation, Inc.
In 1992, Siemens bought out IBM's half of ROLM (Siemens had bought into ROLM 5 years earlier), thus creating SiemensROLM Communications; eventually dropping ROLM from the name later in the 1990s.
In 1997, Siemens agreed to sell the defence arm of Siemens Plessey to British Aerospace (BAe) and a German aerospace company, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace. BAe and DASA acquired the British and German divisions of the operation respectively.[20]
In October 1997, Siemens Financial Services (SFS) was founded to act as competence center for financing issues and as a manager of financial risks within Siemens.
In 1998, Siemens acquired Westinghouse Power Generation for more than $1.5 billion from CBS corp and moving Siemens from third to second the world power generation market.[21]
In 1999, Siemens' semiconductor operations were spun off into a new company called Infineon Technologies. In the same year, Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG became part of Fujitsu Siemens Computers AG, with its retail banking technology group becoming Wincor Nixdorf.
In 2000, Shared Medical Systems Corporation [22] was acquired by the Siemens' Medical Engineering Group,[23] eventually becoming part of Siemens Medical Solutions.
Also in 2000 Atecs-Mannesman was acquired by Siemens,[24] The sale was finalised in April 2001 with 50% of the shares acquired, acquisition, Mannesmann VDO AG merged into Siemens Automotive forming Siemens VDO Automotive AG, Atecs Mannesmann Dematic Systems merged into Siemens Production and Logistics forming Siemens Dematic AG, Mannesmann Demag Delaval merged into the Power Generation division of Siemens AG.[25] Other parts of the company were acquired by Robert Bosch GmbH at the same time.[26]

In March 2007 a Siemens board member was temporarily arrested and accused of illegally financing a business-friendly labour association which competes against the union IG Metall. He has been released on bail. Offices of the labour union and of Siemens have been searched. Siemens denies any wrongdoing.[63] In April the Fixed Networks, Mobile Networks and Carrier Services divisions of Siemens merged with Nokia's Network Business Group in a 50/50 joint venture, creating a fixed and mobile network company called Nokia Siemens Networks. Nokia delayed the merger[64] due to bribery investigations against Siemens.[65] In October 2007, a court in Munich found that the company had bribed public officials in Libya, Russia, and Nigeria in return for the awarding of contracts; four former Nigerian Ministers of Communications were among those named as recipients of the payments. The company admitted to having paid the bribes and agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros. In December 2007, the Nigerian government cancelled a contract with Siemens due to the bribery findings.[66][67]
Also in 2007 Siemens acquired Vai Ingdesi Automation (Argentina, Industrial Automation), UGS Corp., Dade Behring, Sidelco (Quebec, Canada), S/D Engineers Inc., and Gesellschaft für Systemforschung und Dienstleistungen im Gesundheitswesen mbH (GSD) (Germany).
In July 2008, Siemens AG announced a joint venture of the Enterprise Communications business with the Gores Group. The Gores Group holding a majority interest of 51% stake, with Siemens AG holding a minority interest of 49%.[68]
In August 2008, Siemens Project Ventures invested $15 million in the Arava Power Company. In a press release published that month, Peter Löscher, President and CEO of Siemens AG said: “This investment is another consequential step in further strengthening our green and sustainable technologies”. Siemens now holds a 40% stake in the company. [69]
In January 2009, Siemens announced to sell its 34% stake in Framatome, complaining limited managerial influence. In March, it announced to form an alliance with Rosatom of Russia to engage in nuclear-power activities.[18]
In April 2009, Fujitsu Siemens Computers became Fujitsu Technology Solutions as a result of Fujitsu buying out Siemens' share of the company.
In October 2009, Siemens signed a $418 million contract to buy Solel Solar Systems an Israeli company in the solar thermal power business.[70]
In December 2010 Siemens agreed to sell its IT Solutions and Services subsidiary for €850 million to Atos. As part of the deal, Siemens agreed to take a 15% stake in the enlarged Atos, to be held for a minimum of five years. In addition, Siemens concluded a seven-year outsourcing contract worth around €5.5 billion, under which Atos will provide managed services and systems integration to Siemens.
2011 to present[edit]
In March 2011, it was decided to list Osram on the stock market in the autumn, but CEO Peter Löscher said Siemens intended to retain a long-term interest in the company, which was already independent from the technological and managerial viewpoints.
In September 2011 Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the nuclear sector following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. Chief executive Peter Löscher has supported the German government's planned Energiewende, its transition to renewable energy technologies, calling it a "project of the century" and saying Berlin's target of reaching 35% renewable energy sources by 2020 was feasible.[71]
In November 2012, Siemens acquired the Rail division of Invensys for £1.7 billion. In the same month, Siemens made the announcement of acquiring a privately held company, LMS International NV.[72]
In August 2013, Nokia acquired 100% of the company Nokia Siemens Networks, with a buy-out of Siemens AG, ending Siemens role in telecommunication.[73]
In August 2013, Siemens won a $966.8 million order for power plant components from oil firm Saudi Aramco, the largest bid it has ever received from the Saudi company.[74]
In 2014, Siemens plans to build a $264 million facility for making offshore wind turbines in Paull, England, as Britain’s wind power rapidly expands. Siemens chose the Hull area on the east coast of England because it is close to other large offshore projects planned in coming years. The new plant is expected to begin producing turbine rotor blades in 2016. The plant and the associated service center, in Green Port Hull nearby, will employ about 1,000 workers. The facilities will serve the UK market, where the electricity that major power producers generate from wind grew by about 38 percent in 2013, representing about 6 percent of total electricity, according to government figures. There are also plans to increase Britain’s wind-generating capacity at least threefold by 2020, to 14 gigawatts.[75]
In May 2014, Rolls-Royce agreed to sell its gas turbine and compressor energy business to Siemens for £1 Billion.[76] In June 2014 Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries announced their formation of joint ventures to bid for Alstom's troubled energy and transportation businesses (in locomotives, steam turbines, and aircraft engines). A rival bid by General Electric (GE) has been criticized by French government sources, who consider Alstom's operations as a "vital national interest" at a moment when the French unemployment level stands above 10% and some voters are turning towards the far-right.[77]
In September 2014,Siemens said it would buy U.S. oilfield equipment maker Dresser-Rand Group Inc for $7.6 billion[78]

The Siemens Graduate Program (The SGP)[edit]
The Siemens Graduate Program, which has existed since 1922, is the first university graduate program to be established at Siemens. It is an international two-year development program for Master Graduates and PhDs available in various global regions (for example Germany, Denmark, UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Switzerland, Russia, China, India, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt, Brazil, and USA). The SGP consists of three work assignments, one of them abroad, within one of the Siemens Sectors, each lasting eight months. The participants are working at least in two different functional areas during their rotations and are accompanied by a personal mentor for the duration of the program.[91]
Controversies[edit]
In January 2007 Siemens was fined €396 million by the European Commission for price fixing in EU electricity markets through a cartel involving 11 companies, including ABB, Alstom, Fuji, Hitachi Japan, AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider, Areva, Toshiba and VA Tech.[92] According to the Commission, "between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information."[92] Siemens was given the highest fine of €396 million, more than half of the total, for its alleged leadership role in the incident.
Siemens agreed to pay a record $1.34 billion in fines in December 2008[93] after being investigated for serious bribery. The investigation found questionable payments of roughly €1.3 billion, from 2002 to 2006 that triggered a broad range of inquiries in Germany, the United States and many other countries.[94] In May 2007 a German court convicted two former executives of paying about €6 million in bribes from 1999 to 2002 to help Siemens win natural gas turbine supply contracts with Enel, an Italian energy company. The contracts were valued at about €450 million. Siemens was fined €38 million.[95]
Nokia Siemens supplied telecommunications equipment to the Iranian telecom company that included the ability to intercept and monitor telecommunications, a facility known as "lawful intercept". The equipment was believed to have been used in the suppression of the 2009–2010 Iranian election protests, leading to criticism of the company, including by the European Parliament. Nokia-Siemens later divested its call monitoring business, and reduced its activities in Iran.[96][97][98][99][100][101]
Siemens has been accused of bribing Greek officials.[102][103][104] In 2008, it was revealed that Siemens had bribed the two main political parties of Greece for approximately 10 years to be the sole provider of mechanical and electrical equipment of the Greek state.[citation needed] After the exposure the German authorities moved to arrest the representatives of Siemens in Greece, who had managed to escape from the Greek authorities.[105] The German judicial system didn't allow the Greek authorities to cross-question the representatives.[citation needed] As a result, there wasn't any solid evidence against the corrupt politicians, who weren't arrested and continue to be active in the Greek political system.[citation needed] Meanwhile, the Greek state cancelled the planned business deals.[citation needed]

			A2W reactor
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				The A2W reactor is a naval nuclear reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The A2W designation stands for:

A = Aircraft carrier platform
2 = Second generation core designed by the contractor
W = Westinghouse was the contracted designer

This nuclear reactor was used in the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS&#160;Enterprise&#160;(CVN-65). The four propulsion plants on Enterprise each contained two reactors, numbered according to shaft they powered, 1A-1B, 2A-2B, 3A-3B, and 4A-4B. Each propulsion plant was capable of operating on one reactor plant through most of the power range required to propel the ship at speeds in excess of 33 knots (60&#160;km/h), with a possible maximum speed in excess of 30 knots. Both reactors would have been on-line to simultaneously provide maximum ship speed and plane launching capability.
Design and operation[edit]
The reactors are pressurized water reactors fueled by highly enriched (upwards of 93%) uranium-235.[1] Light water is used as both neutron-moderator and reactor coolant. Hafnium Control rods are used to control the operation of the reactor. Extracting the rods to a calculated height allows the reactor to reach criticality, the point at which the nuclear fission reactions reach a self-sustaining level. Thereafter, steam flow (from the steam generators) regulates reactor power as explained below. The control rods are "shimmed" in or out to regulate average coolant temperature or lowered to the bottom of the reactor vessel to shut the reactor down&#160;— either done in a slow controlled manner or dropped rapidly during what is called a SCRAM to immediately shut the reactor down in an emergency.
Much of the reactor power control during steady-state operation comes as a result of the coolant water's negative temperature coefficient. The power of the reactor is determined by the instantaneous rate of fission events that take place in the fuel. As the water heats up, it expands and becomes less dense, which provides fewer molecules per volume to moderate the neutrons, hence fewer neutrons are slowed to the required thermal energies to sustain thermal fission. Conversely, when the coolant water temperature decreases, its density increases and a greater number of neutrons reach the required thermal energy, increasing the number of fissions per unit of time, creating more heat. This has the effect of allowing "steam demand" to control reactor power, requiring little intervention by the Reactor Operator for changes in the power demanded by the ship's operations.
The hot water from the reactors is sent, via large pipes, into heat exchangers called steam generators. There the heat from the pressurized, superheated reactor coolant water is transferred, through tube walls, to water being fed into the steam generators from a separate feed system. In the A1W and A2W systems, the reactor coolant water is kept between 525 and 545&#160;°F (274 and 285&#160;°C). In the steam generators, the water from the feed system is converted to steam at 535&#160;°F (279&#160;°C) and a pressure of about 600&#160;psi (4&#160;MPa). Once the reactor coolant water has given off its heat in the steam generators, it is returned, via large electric pumps (four per reactor), to the reactors to repeat the cycle.
Superheated steam at 600&#160;psi is channeled from each steam generator to a common header, where the steam is then sent to the main engine, electrical generators, aircraft catapult system, and various auxiliaries. The main propulsion turbines are double-ended, in which the steam enters at the center and divides into two streams as it enters the actual turbine wheels, expanding and giving up its energy as it does so, causing the turbine to spin at high speed. The main shaft enters a reduction gear in which the high rotational velocity of the turbine shaft is stepped down to a usable turn rate for propelling the ship. The expended steam from the main engine and other auxiliaries enters condensers to be cooled into liquid water and recycled to the feed system.

crt0 (also known as c0) is a set of execution startup routines linked into a C program that performs any initialization work required before calling the program's main function. It generally takes the form of an object file called crt0.o, often written in assembly language, which is automatically included by the linker into every executable file it builds.[1]
crt0 contains the most basic parts of the runtime library. As such, the exact work it performs depends on the program's compiler, operating system and C standard library implementation.[1] Beside the initialization work required by the environment and toolchain, crt0 can perform additional operations defined by the programmer, such as executing C++ global constructors and C functions carrying the GCC's ((constructor)) attribute.[2][3]
"crt" stands for "C runtime", and the zero stands for "the very beginning". However, when programs are compiled using GCC, it is also used for languages other than C. Alternative versions of crt0 are available for special usage scenarios; for example, the profiler gprof requires its programs to be compiled with gcrt0.[4]

History[edit]



This section requires expansion. (February 2013)


PaR Systems was spun off from General Mills in 1961 under the name Programmed and Remote Systems Corporation.[12]
Contracts[edit]
Defense Contracts[edit]
Jered was the primary contractor for the aircraft elevators on the Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, Tarawa-class, Wasp-class, and half of the Iwo Jima-class ships for the US navy, as well as the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and the Spanish aircraft carrier Príncipe de Asturias.[13][14][15]
Main Crane system[edit]
PaR Systems was awarded the subcontract for the Main Crane System (MCS) for the Chernobyl New Safe Confinement. the system consists of two overhead bridge cranes, which support two 50-ton trolley hoists, and a Mobile Tool Platform (MTP). The MTP is suspended from a third trolley using a wire rope tensile truss with three paired winches, giving the platform six degrees of freedom.[16] the MTP is equipped with a wide variety of tools, including a manipulator arm, that will be needed to dismantle the Sarcaphagus and reactor building so that the radioactive material can be moved to more stable containment. The bridges are 96 meters (315 feet) long, and run on a 150 meters (490 feet) long runway track with six rails. There are shielded garages along the track to allow tools to be exchanged to and from the bridges for maintenance and different operations. Engineering was done by PaR Systems, and manufactured by PaR Systems and PaR Marine. [17][18]
Products[edit]



This section requires expansion. (February 2013)


PaR Systems has several standardized product lines, in addition to custom solutions.
CNC manufacturing[edit]
PaR Systems' line of 5-axis waterjet cutters is sold under the Vector brand. they can be used to cut from three-dimensional objects.[19][20]
Palletizing and packaging[edit]
Hazardous environment[edit]

			Default constructor
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				In computer programming languages the term default constructor can refer to a constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler in the absence of any programmer-defined constructors (e.g. in Java), and is usually a nullary constructor. In other languages (e.g. in C++) it is a constructor that can be called without having to provide any arguments, irrespective of whether the constructor is auto-generated or user-defined. Note that a constructor with formal parameters can still be called without arguments if default arguments were provided in the constructor's definition.
C++[edit]
In C++, the standard describes the default constructor for a class as a constructor that can be called with no arguments (this includes a constructor whose parameters all have default arguments).[1] For example:


class MyClass
{
public:
    MyClass();  // constructor declared

private:
    int x;
};

MyClass :: MyClass() : x(100)  // constructor defined
{
}

int main()
{
    MyClass m;  // at runtime, object m is created, and the default constructor is called
}

When allocating memory dynamically, the constructor may be called by adding parenthesis after the class name. In a sense, this is an explicit call to the constructor:


int main()
{
    MyClass * pointer = new MyClass();  // at runtime, an object is created, and the
                                        // default constructor is called
}

If the constructor does have one or more parameters, but they all have default values, then it is still a default constructor. Remember that each class can have at most one default constructor, either one without parameters, or one whose all parameters have default values, such as in this case:


class MyClass
{
public:
    MyClass (int i = 0, std::string s = "");  // constructor declared

private:
    int x;
    int y;
    std::string z;
};

MyClass :: MyClass(int i, std::string s)     // constructor defined
{
    x = 100;
    y = i;
    z = s;
}

In C++, default constructors are significant because they are automatically invoked in certain circumstances; and therefore, in these circumstances, it is an error for a class to not have a default constructor:

When an object value is declared with no argument list (e.g.: MyClass x;) or allocated dynamically with no argument list (e.g.: new MyClass; or new MyClass();), the default constructor of MyClass is used to initialize the object.
When an array of objects is declared, e.g. MyClass x[10];; or allocated dynamically, e.g. new MyClass [10]. The default constructor of MyClass is used to initialize all the elements.
When a derived class constructor does not explicitly call the base class constructor in its initializer list, the default constructor for the base class is called.
When a class constructor does not explicitly call the constructor of one of its object-valued fields in its initializer list, the default constructor for the field's class is called.
In the standard library, certain containers "fill in" values using the default constructor when the value is not given explicitly. E.g. vector&lt;MyClass&gt;(10); initializes the vector with ten elements, which are filled with a default-constructed MyClass&gt; object.

If a class has no explicitly defined constructors, the compiler will implicitly declare and define a default constructor for it. This implicitly defined default constructor is equivalent to an explicitly defined one with an empty body. For example:[2]


class MyClass
{
    int x;  // no constructor, so the compiler produces an (implicit) default constructor
};

int main()
{
    MyClass m;   // no error at runtime: the (implicit) default constructor is called
}

If constructors are explicitly defined for a class, but they are all non-default, the compiler will not implicitly define a default constructor, leading to a situation where the class does not have a default constructor. This is the reason for a typical error, demonstrated by the following example.


class MyClass
{
public:
    MyClass (int y);  // declaration a non-default constructor

private:
    int x;
};

MyClass :: MyClass (int y)
{
    x = y;
}

int main()
{
    MyClass m(100);     // the non-default constructor is called
    MyClass * p;        // for pointer declarations, the compiler does not need to know about constructors
    p = new MyClass();  // error at compilation: no default constructor
    return 0;
}

Since neither the programmer nor the compiler has defined a default constructor, the creation of the objected pointed to by p leads to an error.[3]
On the other hand in C++11 a default constructor can be explicitly created:


class MyClass
{
public:
    MyClass () = default;  // force generation of a default constructor
};

Or explicitly inhibited:


class MyClass
{
public:
    MyClass () = delete;  // prevent generation of default constructor
};

Java and C#[edit]
In both Java and C#, a "default constructor" refers to a nullary constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler if no constructors have been defined for the class. The default constructor implicitly calls the superclass's nullary constructor, then executes an empty body. All fields are left at their initial value of 0 (integer types), 0.0 (floating-point types), false (boolean type), or null (reference types). A programmer-defined constructor that takes no parameters is also called a default constructor in C#, but not in Java.[4][5]

The Autobahn (German: Autobahn, plural Autobahnen) is the federal controlled-access highway system in Germany. The official German term is Bundesautobahn (plural Bundesautobahnen, abbreviated BAB), which translates as "federal motorway". The literal meaning of the word Bundesautobahn is "Federal Auto(mobile) Track".
German Autobahnen have no federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[1] However limits are posted (and enforced) in areas that are urbanized, substandard, accident-prone, or under construction. In case of bad weather, speed limits come into play and are frequently enforced. On speed-unrestricted stretches, an advisory speed limit (Richtgeschwindigkeit) of 130 kilometres per hour (81&#160;mph) applies. A 2008 estimate reported that 52% of the autobahn network had only the advisory speed limit, 15% had temporary speed limits due to weather or traffic conditions and 33% had permanent speed limits.[2] Measurements from the German State of Brandenburg in 2006 showed average speeds of 142&#160;km/h (88&#160;mph) on a 6-lane section of autobahn in free-flowing conditions.[3]
Germany's autobahn network has a total length of about 12,917 kilometres (8,026&#160;mi) in 2014,[4] which ranks it among the most dense and longest systems in the world. Longer systems can be found e. g. in China 111,950 kilometres (69,560&#160;mi), the United States 77,017 kilometres (47,856&#160;mi) and Spain 16,583 kilometres (10,304&#160;mi).

Names[edit]
Only federally built controlled-access highways with certain construction standards including at least two lanes per direction are called "Bundesautobahn". They have their own, white-on-blue signs and numbering system. In the 1930s, when construction began on the system, the official name was Reichsautobahn. Various other controlled-access highways exist on the federal (Bundesstraße), state (Landesstraße), district and municipal level but are not part of the Autobahn network and are officially referred to as "Kraftfahrstraße" (with rare exceptions, like A 995 Munich-Giesing–Brunntal). These highways are considered "autobahnähnlich" (autobahn similar) and are sometimes colloquially called "Gelbe Autobahn" (yellow autobahn) because most of them are Bundesstraßen (federal highways) with yellow signs. Some controlled-access highways are classified as "Bundesautobahn" in spite of not meeting the autobahn construction standard (for example the A 62 near Pirmasens).
Construction[edit]




Pattern of autobahns 10 to 999


Similar to high-speed motorways in other countries, autobahns have multiple lanes of traffic in each direction, separated by a central barrier with grade-separated junctions and access restricted to motor vehicles with a top speed of more than 60&#160;km/h (37&#160;mph). All exits are to the right. The earliest motorways were flanked by shoulders about 60 centimetres (24&#160;in) in width, constructed of varying materials; right-hand shoulders on many autobahns were later retrofitted to 120 centimetres (47&#160;in) in width when it was realized cars needed the additional space to pull off the autobahn safely. In the postwar years, a thicker asphaltic concrete cross-section with full paved hard shoulders came into general use. The top design speed was approximately 160&#160;km/h (99&#160;mph) in flat country but lower design speeds were used in hilly or mountainous terrain. A flat-country autobahn that was constructed to meet standards during the Nazi period, could support the speed of up to 150&#160;km/h (93&#160;mph) on curves.
The current autobahn numbering system in use in Germany was introduced in 1974. All autobahns are named by using the capital letter A, which simply stands for "Autobahn" followed by a blank and a number (for example A&#160;8). The main autobahns going all across Germany have a single digit number. Shorter autobahns that are of regional importance (e.g. connecting two major cities or regions within Germany) have a double digit number (e.g. A&#160;24, connecting Berlin and Hamburg). The system is as follows:

A&#160;10 to A&#160;19 are in eastern Germany (Berlin, Saxony-Anhalt, parts of Saxony and Brandenburg)
A&#160;20 to A&#160;29 are in northern and northeastern Germany
A&#160;30 to A&#160;39 are in Lower Saxony (northwestern Germany) and Thuringia
A&#160;40 to A&#160;49 are in the Rhine-Ruhr to Frankfurt Rhine-Main
A&#160;50 to A&#160;59 are in the Lower Rhine region to Cologne
A&#160;60 to A&#160;69 are in Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Hesse
A&#160;70 to A&#160;79 are in Thuringia, northern Bavaria and parts of Saxony
A&#160;80 to A&#160;89 are in Baden-Württemberg
A&#160;90 to A&#160;99 are in (southern) Bavaria

There are also some very short autobahns built just for local traffic (e.g. ring roads or the A&#160;555 from Cologne to Bonn) that usually have three digits for numbering. The first digit used is similar to the system above, depending on the region. East-west routes are always even-numbered, north-south routes are always odd-numbered.
The north-south autobahns are generally numbered using odd numbers from west to east; that is to say, the more easterly roads are given higher numbers. Similarly, the east-west routes are numbered using even numbers from north (lower numbers) to south (higher numbers).
History[edit]
Main article: Reichsautobahn




Rare sight in Europe: 4 lanes in each direction of travel for 21 kilometers. The section between Zeppelinheim and Darmstadt, it is the oldest Autobahn.






Typical section of modern autobahn near an interchange, with overhead direction signs.


The idea for the construction of the autobahn was first conceived in the mid-1920s during the days of the Weimar Republic, but the construction was slow, and most projected sections did not progress much beyond the planning stage due to economic problems and a lack of political support. One project was the private initiative HaFraBa which planned a "car only road" crossing Germany from Hamburg in the North via central Frankfurt am Main to Basel in Switzerland. Parts of the HaFraBa were completed in the late 1930s and early 1940s, but construction eventually was halted by World War II. The first public road of this kind was completed in 1932 between Cologne and Bonn and opened by Konrad Adenauer (Lord Mayor of Cologne and future Chancellor of West Germany) on 6 August 1932.[5] Today, that road is the Bundesautobahn 555.[6][7][8] This road was not yet called Autobahn and lacked a center median like modern motorways, but instead was termed a Kraftfahrstraße ("motor vehicle road") with two lanes each direction without intersections, pedestrians, bicycles, or animal-powered transportation.[9]
Just days after the 1933 Nazi takeover, Adolf Hitler enthusiastically embraced an ambitious autobahn construction project, appointing Fritz Todt, the Inspector General of German Road Construction, to lead it. By 1936, 130,000 workers were directly employed in construction, as well as an additional 270,000 in the supply chain for construction equipment, steel, concrete, signage, maintenance equipment, etc. In rural areas, new camps to house the workers were built near construction sites.[10] The job creation program aspect was not especially important because full employment was almost reached by 1936. The autobahns were not primarily intended as major infrastructure improvement of special value to the military as often stated. Their military value was limited as all major military transports in Germany were done by train to save fuel. The propaganda ministry turned the construction of the autobahns into a major media event that attracted international attention.[11]




One of the center abutment-free bridges over the former Dessauer Rennstrecke on Autobahn A9


The autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935. This straight section was used for high speed record attempts by the Grand Prix racing teams of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer in early 1938. The world record of 432&#160;km/h (268&#160;mph) set by Rudolf Caracciola on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway. A similar intent in the 1930s existed for a ten kilometer stretch of what is today Bundesautobahn 9 just south of Dessau — called the Dessauer Rennstrecke — had bridges with no abutments over the median, meant for land speed record cars like the Mercedes-Benz T80 to have made a record attempt in January 1940, abandoned due to the outbreak of World War II in Europe four months earlier.

The A 3 in 1991


During World War II, the median strips of some autobahns were paved over to allow their conversion into auxiliary airstrips. Aircraft were either stashed in numerous tunnels or camouflaged in nearby woods. However, for the most part during the war, the autobahns were not militarily significant. Motor vehicles, such as trucks, could not carry goods or troops as quickly or in as much bulk and in the same numbers as trains could, and the autobahns could not be used by tanks as their weight and caterpillar tracks damaged the road surface. The general shortage of petrol in Germany during much of the war, as well as the low number of trucks and motor vehicles needed for direct support of military operations, further decreased the autobahn's significance. As a result, most military and economic freight was carried by rail. After the war, numerous sections of the autobahns were in bad shape, severely damaged by heavy Allied bombing and military demolition. Furthermore, thousands of kilometres of autobahns remained unfinished, their construction brought to a halt by 1943 due to the increasing demands of the war effort.[12][13]
In West Germany (GFR), most existing autobahns were repaired soon after the war. During the 1950s, the West German government restarted the construction program. It invested in new sections and in improvements to older ones. Finishing the incomplete sections took longer, with some stretches opened to traffic by the 1980s. Some sections cut by the Iron Curtain in 1945 were only completed after German reunification in 1990. Others were never completed, as more advantageous routes were found. Some of these incomplete sections to this very day stretch across the landscape forming a unique type of modern ruin, often easily visible on satellite photographs.
The autobahns of East Germany (GDR) were neglected in comparison to those in West Germany after 1945. East German autobahns were used primarily for GDR military traffic and for state-owned farming or manufacturing vehicles. The speed limit on the GDR autobahns was 100&#160;km/h; however, lower speed limits were frequently encountered due to poor or quickly changing road conditions. The speed limits on the GDR autobahns were rigorously enforced by the Volkspolizei, whose patrol cars were frequently found hiding under camouflage tarpaulins waiting for speeders.
The last four kilometers of remaining original Reichsautobahn, a section of A 11 northeast of Berlin near Gartz built in 1936 — the westernmost remainder of the never-finished Berlinka — are scheduled for replacement around 2015.[14][15] Roadway condition is described as "deplorable"; the 25-metre-long concrete slabs, too long for proper expansion, are cracking under the weight of the traffic as well as the weather.[16]
German-built Reichsautobahnen in other countries[edit]
The first autobahn in Austria was the West Autobahn from Wals near Salzburg to Vienna. Building started by command of Adolf Hitler shortly after the Anschluss in 1938. It extended the Reichsautobahn 26 from Munich (the present-day A8), however only 16.8&#160;km (10.4&#160;mi) including the branch-off of the planned Tauern Autobahn was opened to the public on 13 September 1941.[17] Construction works discontinued the next year and were not resumed until 1955.
There are sections of the former German Reichsautobahn system in the former eastern territories of Germany, i.e. East Prussia, Farther Pomerania and Silesia; these territories became parts of Poland and the Soviet Union with the implementation of the Oder–Neisse line after World War II. Parts of the planned autobahn from Berlin to Königsberg (the Berlinka) were completed as far as Stettin (Szczecin) on 27 September 1936. After the war, they were incorporated as the A6 autostrada of the Polish motorway network. A single-vehicle section of the Berlinka east of the former "Polish Corridor" and the Free City of Danzig opened in 1938; today it forms the Polish S22 expressway from Elbląg (Elbing) to the border with the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast, where it is continued by the R516 regional road. Also on 27 September 1936, a section from Breslau (Wrocław) to Liegnitz (Legnica) in Silesia was inaugurated, which today is part of the Polish A4 autostrada, followed by the (single vehicle) Reichsautobahn 9 from Bunzlau (Bolesławiec) to Sagan (Żagań) the next year, today part of the Polish A18 autostrada.
After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, plans for a motorway connecting Breslau with Vienna via Brno (Brünn) in the "Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia" were carried out from 1939 until construction works discontinued in 1942. A section of the former Strecke 88 near Brno is today part of the R52 expressway of the Czech Republic.
Current density[edit]
As of 2013[update], Germany's autobahn network has a total length of about 12,845&#160;km. From 2009 Germany has embarked on a massive widening and rehabilitation project, expanding the lane count of many of its major arterial routes, such as the A5 in the southwest and A8 going east-west.
Most sections of Germany's autobahns are modern, containing two or three, sometimes four lanes in addition to an emergency lane (hard shoulder). A few other sections remain in an old state, with two lanes, no emergency lane, and short slip-roads and ramps.
Facilities[edit]
Emergency telephones[edit]

About 16,000 emergency telephones are distributed at regular intervals all along the autobahn network, with triangular stickers on the armco barriers pointing the way to the nearest one. Despite the increasing use of mobile phones, there are still some 700 calls made each day on average.
For the Emergency service or Roadside assistance to come to the right location, the road kilometer must be given as part of the emergency call.[18]

Parking, rest areas and truck stops[edit]
For breaks during longer journeys, parking sites, rest areas and truck stops are distributed over the complete Autobahn network. Parking on the autobahn is prohibited in the strictest terms outside these designated areas. There is a distinction between "managed" and "unmanaged" rest areas. (German: "bewirtschaftet" / "unbewirtschaftet").

Unmanaged rest areas are basically only parking spaces, sometimes with toilets. They form a part of the German highway system; the plots of land are federal property. Autobahn exits leading to such parking areas are marked 200 metres in advance with a blue sign with the white letter "P". They are found every few kilometres.
A managed rest area (German: "Autobahnraststätte" or "Raststätte" for short) usually also includes a filling station, lavatories, toilets and baby changes. Many rest areas also have restaurants, shops, public telephones, internet access and a playground. Some have hotels. Mandated every 50&#160;km or so, rest areas are usually open all night.
Both kinds of rest areas are directly on the autobahn, with their own exits, and any service roads connecting them to the rest of the road network are usually closed to general traffic. The autobahn must not be left at rest areas.

Truck stops (German "Autohof", plural "Autohöfe") are far rarer. Located at general exits, usually at a small distance from the autobahn, they have no ramps of their own.

Rest area Dammer Berge on the A 1





Rest areas and truck stops are marked several times, starting several kilometres in advance, and with larger signs that often include icons announcing what kinds of facilities travellers can expect.
Speed limits[edit]




This autobahn has three separated lanes in each direction and an emergency lane.






On the autobahns there is an advisory speed limit (Richtgeschwindigkeit) of 130 km/h (unless otherwise regulated by signs).






The "limits no longer apply" (Ende aller Streckenverbote) sign, indicating a return to the default speed, while lifting all other limits as well (all limits are indicated by round signs with red border).[19]






GPS tracks colored according to speed show considerable speed differences at an autobahn crossing


Germany's autobahns are famous for being among the few public roads in the world without blanket speed limits for cars and motorbikes. As such, they are important German cultural identifiers, "... often mentioned in hushed, reverential tones by motoring enthusiasts and looked at with a mix of awe and terror by outsiders."[1]
Certain limits are imposed on some classes of vehicles:


60&#160;km/h (37&#160;mph)


Buses carrying standing passengers
Motorcycles pulling trailers




80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph)


Vehicles with maximum allowed weight exceeding 3.5 t (except passenger cars)
Passenger cars and trucks with trailers
Buses




100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph)


Passenger cars pulling trailers certified for 100&#160;km/h
Buses certified for 100&#160;km/h not towing trailers[20]




Additionally, speed limits are posted at most on- and off-ramps and interchanges[21] and other danger points like sections under construction or in need of repair.
Where no general limit is required, the advisory speed limit is 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph), referred to in German as the Richtgeschwindigkeit. The advisory speed is not enforceable; however, being involved in an accident driving at higher speeds can lead to the driver being deemed at least partially responsible due to "increased operating danger" (Erhöhte Betriebsgefahr).
The Federal Highway Research Institute (Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen) solicited information about speed regulations on autobahns from the sixteen States and reported the following, comparing the years 2006 and 2008:

Except at construction sites, the general speed limits, where they apply, are usually between 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) and 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph); construction sites usually have a speed limit of 80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph) but the limit may be as low as 60&#160;km/h (37&#160;mph)[23] or, in very rare cases, 40&#160;km/h (25&#160;mph).[24] Certain stretches have lower speed limits during wet weather. Some areas have a speed limit of 120&#160;km/h (75&#160;mph) in order to reduce noise pollution during overnight hours (usually 10pm – 6am) or because of increased traffic during daytime (6am – 8pm).




Dynamic traffic signs on an Autobahn.


Some limits were imposed to reduce pollution and noise. Limits can also be temporarily put into place through dynamic traffic guidance systems that display the according message. More than half of the total length of the German autobahn network has no speed limit, about one third has a permanent limit, and the remaining parts have a temporary or conditional limit.
Some cars with very powerful engines can reach speeds of well over 300&#160;km/h (190&#160;mph). Major German car manufacturers, except Porsche, follow a gentlemen's agreement by electronically limiting the top speeds of their cars – with the exception of some top of the range models or engines – to 250&#160;km/h (155&#160;mph).[25] These limiters can be deactivated, so speeds up to 300&#160;km/h (190&#160;mph) might arise on the German autobahn, but due to other traffic, such speeds are generally not attainable. Most unlimited sections of the autobahn are located outside densely populated areas.
Vehicles with a top speed less than 60&#160;km/h (37&#160;mph) (such as quads, low-end microcars, and agricultural/construction equipment) are not allowed to use the autobahn, nor are motorcycles and scooters with low engine capacity regardless of top speed (mainly applicable to mopeds which are typically limited to 25 or 45&#160;km/h anyway). To comply with this limit, heavy-duty trucks in Germany (e.g. mobile cranes, tank transporters etc.) often have a maximum design speed of 62&#160;km/h (39&#160;mph) (usually denoted by a round black-on-white sign with "62" on it), along with flashing orange beacons to warn approaching cars that they are travelling slowly. There is no general minimum speed but drivers are not allowed to drive at an unnecessarily low speed as this would lead to significant traffic disturbance and an increased collision risk.
The following map with its associated legend shows the speed limits applied to different sections of the autobahn network.
Public debate[edit]
German national speed limits have a historical association[26] with war-time restrictions and deprivations, the Nazi era, and the Soviet era in East Germany. "Free driving for free citizens" ("freie Fahrt für freie Bürger"), a slogan promoted by the German Auto Club since the 1970s,[27] is a popular slogan among those opposing autobahn speed restrictions.[28][29][30] Tarek Al-Wazir, head of the Green Party in Hesse, and currently the Hessian Transport Minister has stated that "the speed limit in Germany has a similar status as the right to bear arms in the American debate... A speed limit will be at some point reality here, and soon we will be able not imagine ourselves without it. It's like the smoking ban in restaurants."[31]
Early history[edit]
The Weimar Republic had no federally required speed limits. The first crossroads-free road for motorized vehicles only, now A555 between Bonn and Cologne, had a 120&#160;km/h (75&#160;mph) limit when it opened in 1932.[32] In October 1939, the Nazis instituted the first national maximum speed limit, throttling speeds to 80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph) in order to conserve gasoline for the war effort.[33] After the war, the four Allied occupation zones established their own speed limits until the divided East German and West German republics were constituted in 1949; initially, the Nazi speed limits were restored in both East and West Germany.[34]
After the World Wars[edit]
In December 1952 the West German legislature voted to abolish all national speed limits, seeing them as Nazi relics,[35] reverting to State-level decisions. National limits were reestablished incrementally. The 50&#160;km/h (31&#160;mph) urban limit was enacted in 1956, effective in 1957.[36] The 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) limit on rural roads—except autobahns—became effective in 1972.
Oil crisis of the 1970s[edit]
Just prior to the 1973 oil crisis Germany, Switzerland[37] and Austria[38][39] all had no general speed restriction on autobahns. During the crisis, like other nations, Germany imposed temporary speed restrictions; for example, 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) on autobahns effective November 13, 1973.[40] Automakers projected a 20% plunge in sales, which they attributed in part to the lowered speed limits.[41] The 100&#160;km/h limit championed by Transportation Minister Lauritz Lauritzen lasted 111 days.[42] Adjacent nations with unlimited speed autobahns, Austria[39][43] and Switzerland,[37] imposed permanent 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph) limits after the crisis.
However, after the crisis eased in 1974, the upper house of the German parliament, which was controlled by conservative parties, successfully resisted the imposition of a permanent mandatory limit supported by Chancellor Brandt.[44] The upper house insisted on a 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph) recommended limit until a thorough study of the effects of a mandatory limit could be conducted.[45] Accordingly, the Federal Highway Research Institute conducted a multiple-year experiment, switching between mandatory and recommended limits on two test stretches of autobahn. In the final report issued in 1977, the Institute stated the mandatory speed limit could reduce the autobahn death toll but there would be economic impacts, so a political decision had to be made due to the trade-offs involved.[46] At that time, the Federal Government declined to impose a mandatory limit.[47] The fatality rate trend on the German autobahn mirrored those of other nations' motorways that imposed a general speed limit.[48]
Environmental concerns of the 1980s[edit]
In the mid-1980s, acid rain and sudden forest destruction renewed debate on whether or not a general speed limit should be imposed on autobahns.[49][50] A car's fuel consumption increases with high speed, and fuel conservation is a key factor in reducing air pollution. Environmentalists argued that enforcing limits of 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) limit on autobahns and 80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph) on other rural roads would save lives as well as the forest, reducing the annual death toll by 30% (250 lives) on autobahns and 15% (1000 lives) on rural roads;[51] the German motor vehicle death toll was about 10,000 at the time.[52] The Federal Government sponsored a large-scale experiment with a 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) speed limit in order to measure the impact of reduced speeds on emissions and compliance.[53] Afterward, again, the Federal Government declined to impose a mandatory limit, deciding the modest measured emission reduction would have no meaningful effect on forest loss.[54] By 1987 all restrictions on test sections had been removed, even in Hesse where the state government was controlled by a "red-green" coalition.[55]
German reunification[edit]
Prior to German reunification in 1990, eastern German states focused on restrictive traffic regulation such as a 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) autobahn speed limit and of 80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph) on other rural roads. Within two years after the opening, availability of high-powered vehicles and a 54% increase in motorized traffic led to a doubling of annual traffic deaths,[56] despite "interim arrangements [which] involved the continuation of the speed limit of 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) on autobahns and of 80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph) outside cities". An extensive program of the four Es (enforcement, education, engineering, and emergency response) brought the number of traffic deaths back to pre-unification levels after a decade of effort while traffic regulations were conformed to western standards (e.g., 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph) freeway advisory limit, 100&#160;km/h (62&#160;mph) on other rural roads, and 0.05 percent BAC).[57]
Since reunification[edit]
In 1993, the Social democratic-Green Party coalition controlling the State of Hesse experimented with a 90&#160;km/h (56&#160;mph) limit on autobahns and 80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph) on other rural roads.[58] These limits were attempts to reduce ozone pollution.
During his term of office (1998 to 2005) as Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder opposed an autobahn speed limit, famously referring to Germany as an Autofahrernation (a "nation of drivers").
In October 2007, at a party congress held by the Social Democratic Party of Germany, delegates narrowly approved a proposal to introduce a blanket speed limit of 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph) on all German autobahns.[59] While this initiative is primarily a part of the SPD's general strategic outline for the future and, according to practices, not necessarily meant to affect immediate government policy, the proposal had stirred up a debate once again; Germany's chancellor since 2005, Angela Merkel, and leading cabinet members expressed outspoken disapproval of such a measure.[60][61]
In 2008, the Social Democratic-Green Party coalition controlling the Germany's smallest State, the paired City-State of Bremen &amp; Bremerhaven, imposed a 120 kilometres per hour (75&#160;mph) limit on its last 11 kilometres (6.8&#160;mi) of speed-unlimited autobahn[62] in hopes of leading other States to do likewise.[63]
In 2011, the first ever Green minister-president of any German state, Winfried Kretschmann of Baden-Württemberg initially argued for a similar, state-level 120 kilometres per hour (75&#160;mph) limit.[64] However, Baden-Württemberg is an important location for the German motor industry, including the headquarters of Daimler AG and Porsche;[65] the ruling coalition ultimately decided against a state-level limit on its 675 kilometres (419&#160;mi) of speed-unlimited roads—arguing for nationwide speed limit instead.[66][67][68]
In 2014, the conservative-liberal ruling coalition of Saxony confirmed its rejection of a general speed limit on autobahns, instead advocating dynamic traffic controls where appropriate.[69] Between 2010 and 2014 in the State of Hesse, transportation ministers Dieter Posch[70] and his successor[71] Florian Rentsch,[72] both members of the Free Democratic Party, removed or raised speed limits on several sections of autobahn following regular 5-year reviews of speed limit effectiveness; some sections just prior to the installation of Tarek Al-Wazir (Green Party) as Transportation Minister in January 2014.[73][74]
In 2015, the left-green coalition government of Thuringia declared that a general autobahn limit was a Federal matter; Thuringia would not unlaterally impose a general Statewide limit, although the Thuringian environmental minister had recommended a 120 kilometres per hour (75&#160;mph) limit.[75]
Safety[edit]
In 2013, autobahns carried 31% of motorized road traffic while accounting for 13% of Germany's traffic deaths. The autobahn fatality rate of 1.9 deaths per billion-travel-kilometers compared favorably with the 4.7 rate on urban streets and 6.6 rate on rural roads.[52]
Between 1970 and 2010, overall German road fatalities decreased by almost 80% from 19,193 to 3,648; over the same time period, autobahn deaths halved from 945 to 430 deaths.[52] Statistics for 2013 show total German traffic deaths declined to the lowest count ever recorded: 3340; a representative of the Federal Statistical Office attributed the general decline to harsh winter weather that delayed the start of the motorcycle-riding season.[76] However, autobahn deaths increased over 2012 counts (from 387 to 428);[52] in 2014, total German fatalities rose slightly to 3377 while autobahn deaths dropped to 375.[77]

In 2012, the leading cause of autobahn accidents was "excessive speed (for conditions)": 6,587 so-called "speed related" crashes claimed the lives of 179 people, which represents almost half (46.3%) of 387 autobahn fatalities that year.[78] However, "excessive speed" does not mean that a speed limit has been exceeded, but that police determined at least one party travelled too fast for existing road[79] or weather conditions.[78] On autobahns 22 people died per 1000 injury crashes; a lower rate than the 29 deaths per 1,000 injury accidents on conventional rural roads, which in turn is five times higher than the risk on urban roads – speeds are higher on rural roads and autobahns than urban roads, increasing the severity potential of a crash.[78]

There are many differences between countries in their geography, economy, traffic growth, highway system size, degree of urbanization and motorization, and so on; all of which need to be taken into consideration when comparisons are made, even as there are many regional differences between U.S. States.[81]
Travel speeds[edit]
The Federal government does not regularly measure or estimate travel speeds.[82] One study reported in a transportation engineering journal offered historical perspective on the increase in travel speeds over a decade, as shown below.

The Federal Environmental Office reported that, on an free-flowing section in 1992, the recorded average speed was 132&#160;km/h (82&#160;mph) with 51% of drivers exceeding the recommended speed.[84]
In 2006, speeds were recorded using automated detection loops in the State of Brandenburg at two points: on a 6-lane section of A9 near Niemegk with a 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph) advisory speed limit; and on a 4-lane section of A10 bypassing Berlin near Groß Kreutz with a 120&#160;km/h (75&#160;mph) mandatory limit.[85] The results are shown below:

At peak times on the "free-flowing" section of A9, over 60% of road users exceeded the recommended 130&#160;km/h (81&#160;mph) maximum speed, more than 30% of motorists exceeded 150&#160;km/h (93&#160;mph), and more than 15% exceeded 170&#160;km/h (106&#160;mph)—in other words the so-called "85th percentile speed" was in excess of 170&#160;km/h.[86]
Toll roads[edit]
On 1 January 2005, a new system came into effect for mandatory tolls (Mautpflicht) on heavy trucks (those weighing more than 12 t) while using the German autobahn system (LKW-Maut). The German government contracted with a private company, Toll Collect GmbH, to operate the toll collection system, which has involved the use of vehicle-mounted transponders and roadway-mounted sensors installed throughout Germany. The toll is calculated depending on the toll route, as well as based on the pollution class of the vehicle, its weight and the number of axles on the vehicles. Certain vehicles, such as emergency vehicles and buses, are exempt from the toll. An average user is charged €0.15 per kilometre, or about $0.31 per mile (Toll Collect, 2007).
Traffic laws and enforcement[edit]

Driving in Germany is regulated by the Straßenverkehrs-Ordnung (road traffic regulations,[87] abbreviated StVO). Enforcement on the federal Autobahnen is handled by each State's Highway Patrol (Autobahnpolizei), often using unmarked police cars and motorcycles and usually equipped with video cameras,[88][89] thus allowing easier enforcement of laws such as tailgating. Notable laws include the following.

The right lane should be used when it is free (Rechtsfahrgebot) and the left lane is generally intended only for overtaking, unless traffic is too dense to justify driving only on the right lane. It is legal to give a short horn or light signal (flashing headlights or Lichthupe) in order to indicate the intention of overtaking, but a safe distance to the vehicle in front must be maintained,[90] otherwise this might be regarded as an act of coercion.
Penalties for tailgating were increased in May 2006 to a maximum of €375 and three months license suspension:[91] "drivers must keep a distance in meters that is equal to half their speed. For example, a driver going 100 kph on the autobahn must keep a distance of at least 50 meters (165 feet)". The penalty increase followed uproar after an infamous fatal crash on Autobahn 5 in 2003.[92]
In a traffic jam, drivers must form an emergency lane to allow emergency services to reach an accident scene. This "lane" is the middle of the left two lanes.[93]
It is unlawful to stop for any reason on the autobahn, except for emergencies and when unavoidable, like traffic jams or being involved in an accident. This includes stopping on emergency lanes. Running out of fuel is considered an avoidable occurrence, as by law there are petrol stations directly on the autobahn approximately every 50–55&#160;km (31–34&#160;mi). Drivers may face fines and up to six months suspension, should it come to a stop that was deemed unnecessary by the police. In some cases (if there is direct danger to life and limb or property e.g. cars and highway infrastructure) it may also be considered a crime and the driver could receive a prison sentence (up to 5 years).
Overtaking on the right (undertaking) is strictly forbidden, except when stuck in traffic jams. Up to a speed of 80&#160;km/h (50&#160;mph) it is permitted to pass cars on the right side if the speed difference is not greater than 20&#160;km/h (12&#160;mph) or the vehicle on the left lane is stationary. This is not referred to as overtaking, but driving past. Even if the car overtaken is illegally occupying the left-hand lane, it is not an acceptable excuse; in such cases the police will routinely stop and fine both drivers. However, exceptions can and have sometimes been made.
There is a general duty to rescue in Germany. If there is an accident, a driver is obliged to stop and help, whenever and to the degree to which it is possible. Doctors, even if they are not Germans or living in Germany, are obliged to stop and help, unless an ambulance is already at the scene.
First aid training is mandatory in order to obtain a driving licence in Germany, also every vehicle has to carry a first-aid-kit.
The tires must be approved for the vehicle's top speed; winter tires (mud + snow) for lower speeds (i.e. cheaper than high-speed tires) are allowed, but the driver must have a sticker in the vehicle reminding of the tires' maximum speed.
Winter tires are compulsory when wintery road conditions are present. M+S tires (mud and snow or all-season) are acceptable. Non-compliance would lead to legal consequences in the event of an accident and will result in problems with insurance coverage. This also applies to rental cars. It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure his rental car has winter tires (by ordering them specially).

Driving at higher speeds than the recommended 130&#160;km/h on unrestricted autobahns means a minimum 30 percent of legal liability in case of a crash, even if the driver is not otherwise at fault.[94]

Video games[edit]
Need for Speed: ProStreet, Burnout 3: Takedown, Euro Truck Simulator 2 and Burnout Dominator use autobahn as one of their tracks. Burnout 3: Takedown named them as Alpine while Burnout Dominator divided them into two (Autobahn and Autobahn Loop). Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed also had a track that had the player drive across different sections of the autobahn. The entire game world of Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit is set on the autobahn. On Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6, a trophy is awarded to those who have driven the same distance as the autobahn total length. In December 2010 video game developer Synetic GmbH and Conspiracy Entertainment released the title Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei featuring real world racing and mission based gameplay it is taken from the popular German television series about a two-man team of Autobahnpolizei first set in Berlin then later in North Rhine-Westphalia.

(Seite 20) Hauptunfallursache auf Autobahnen ist die „nicht angepasste Geschwindigkeit“. Im Jahr 2012 waren mehr als ein Drittel aller Unfälle mit Personenschaden auf Autobahnen Unfälle, bei denen mindestens einem Beteiligten dieses Fehlverhalten zur Last gelegt wurde. Bei insgesamt 6 587 sogenannten Geschwindigkeitsunfällen kamen 179 Menschen zu Tode, das heißt nahezu die Hälfte (46,3&#160;%) aller Getöteten auf Autobahnen...

Die Frau musste noch vor Ort reanimiert werden, starb jedoch später im Krankenhaus. Die beiden Männer im Porsche kamen mit leichten Verletzungen davon...

Drivers who ride the bumper of the car in front of them can now expect a fine of up to 375 euros (nearly $470), a rise of nearly 100 euros from the previous maximum, said Sven Stadtrecher, a German police liaison officer to the U.S. military in Heidelberg. Drivers can also lose their license for up to three months. Before the new regulations went into effect, a monthlong suspension was the maximum penalty, he said. Fines will start at 35 euros for a speed of 80 kilometers an hour, Stadtrecher said, adding that drivers must keep a distance in meters that is equal to half their speed. For example, a driver going 100 km/h on the autobahn must keep a distance of at least 50 meters (165 feet). Fines and penalties will increase at higher speeds and will also take into account how long the driver tailgates.&#160;

Patents[edit]
During the 20th century, Westinghouse engineers and scientists were granted more than 28,000 US government patents, the third most of any company.[14]
Westinghouse Electric Company and CBS Corporation[edit]
Naming Rights[edit]
Further information: Westinghouse Licensing
Although no longer associated with the current CBS Corporation, Westinghouse Electric Company LLC as of 2011 still uses the trademarks owned by Westinghouse Licensing Corporation,[15] CBS' brand management subsidiary, under license, as is the case with other Westinghouse licensees.
KDKA Radio[edit]
Westinghouse Electric Company was the primary sponsor in 2010 for the 90th anniversary celebration of KDKA, a radio station licensed to Pittsburgh, launched by the original Westinghouse on November 2, 1920, and which is now owned by CBS Radio.
New generation of reactors[edit]
A revived interest in the nuclear power generation field[when?] led to Westinghouse's development of the AP1000 reactor, the first Generation III+ reactor to receive final design approval from the NRC in 2004.[16] As of 2014, four of these units are under construction in China, though the first was due to come on-line in November 2013.[17] and has been delayed until December 2014. The delay due to the constantly changing, and consequently untested, design prompted Li Yulun, former vice-president of China National Nuclear Corporation, in 2013 to raise concerns over the safety standards of the plant. Citing a lack of operating history, he questioned the manufacturer's assertion that the AP1000 reactor's "primary system canned motor pumps" were "maintenance-free" over 60 years, the assumed life of the reactor, and noted that Westinghouse had yet to receive approval from British authorities on an improved version of AP1000.[18]
As of January 2009, six AP1000 plants had been ordered in the US, and several other customers had chosen the AP1000, if they were to build new nuclear plants, for a combined total of at least 14 new plants, announced by the NuStart Consortium, Duke Power, Progress Energy, Southern Nuclear and SCE&amp;G.[17] In May 2011 after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, US government regulators found problems with the design of the shield building of the new reactors. Gregory Jaczko, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since 2005 said that computations submitted by Westinghouse about the building’s design appeared to be wrong and “had led to more questions.” He said the company had not used a range of possible temperatures for calculating potential seismic stresses on the shield building in the event of an earthquake, for example. The NRC asked Westinghouse not only to fix its calculations, but also to explain why it submitted flawed information in the first place. Westinghouse countered that the “confirmatory items” that the commission was asking for were not “safety significant.”[19]
In November 2011, the AP1000 Oversight Group published a report highlighting six areas of major concern and un-reviewed safety questions requiring immediate technical review by the NRC. The report concluded that certification of the AP1000 should be delayed until the original and current “unanswered safety questions” raised by the AP1000 Oversight Group are resolved.[20]
In December 2011, the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation published a design assessment report on the AP1000 reactor which highlighted 51 'Generic Design Assessment' issues remaining that must be addressed before the assessment would be completed.[21]
In October 2013, US energy secretary Ernest Moniz announced that China was to supply components to the US nuclear power plants under construction as part of a bilateral co-operation agreement between the two countries. Since China’s State Nuclear Power Technology Co (SNPTC) acquired Westinghouses's AP1000 technology in 2006, it has developed a manufacturing supply chain capable of supplying international power projects.[22] Industry analysts have pointed out that there are gaps in the Chinese supply chain.[23]
International business[edit]
Europe[edit]
Westinghouse Electric Company fully owns several subsidiaries in Europe, such as the European Service Center, also called Westinghouse Electric Belgium located in Nivelles, Belgium, where equipment is prepared for projects throughout Europe. After Westinghouse's 1990 takeover of ABB Reaktor in Germany, it transferred radiological storage activities located in Ladenburg, Germany, to consolidate in Nivelles, which had to be extended.[citation needed] Soon afterwards[when?] another expansion was necessary as employees in the Brussels office were transferred to Nivelles. It was estimated that 200 people were working in Nivelles at the end of 2011.[who?][citation needed]
In 2001, Westinghouse took over Logitest in Les Ulis, France, one of 3 companies qualified to inspect nuclear steam generator plants for Electricité de France.[24] After the French nuclear market partially opened in 2004 to suppliers from outside the country to fulfill European Commission directives regarding international competition, Westinghouse started to expand its business in France with a Westinghouse team located in Metz in charge of repair, replacement and automation services. By 2005 Westinghouse had 160 employees in France and two-thirds of Westinghouse's business in France was fuel supply.[25] Westinghouse Electrique France is located in Orsay and Manosque near Marseille (engineering development). As of 2014, about 400 employees are part of Westinghouse in France.
Westinghouse owns a nuclear fuel fabrication plant at Västerås, Sweden which has provided nuclear fuel for nuclear reactors from Eastern Block countries. The 2008 contract with Ukraine has been crucial for the plant.
Nuclear power in Ukraine
Westinghouse also has business locations in Germany, Spain, the UK, Russia, and Bulgaria.
Asia[edit]
In South Korea, Westinghouse has been involved in the construction of new nuclear plants since 1972, with the first plant Kori Nuclear Power Plant starting up in 1977 and in commercial operation in 1978, followed by eight reactors under construction in the early 1980s. Combustion Engineering (now Westinghouse) entered into a ten-year technology transfer program with the Korean nuclear industry aiming at self-reliance, which was extended in 1997.[26]
In December, 2006, China’s State Nuclear Power Technology Company (SNPTC) selected Westinghouse to provide four new AP1000 nuclear power plants.[14] The first was due to come on line in 2013, has been delayed until the end of 2014.[18]
Africa[edit]
Westinghouse has been involved in South Africa through support of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station since the 1990s, both reactors are Westinghouse-licensed. In 2007 Westinghouse acquired IST Nuclear (Pty) Ltd, and won the final bidding process for new nuclear plants in South Africa, for which it signed an MOU in 2013.[27] IST Nuclear provides services and systems for the pebble-bed reactor.
Environmental Record[edit]
There have been a number of major Westinghouse-related environmental incidents in the US. Below is a short list of these.

Sharon Plant: The Westinghouse Sharon Plant is a 58-acre facility Westinghouse power-plant and production facility in Mercer County, Pennsylvania. The EPA's Recent Second 5-Year Overview (2013) of this toxic Superfund site determined that the Shenango River is heavily polluted due to Westinghouse operations in this area. The report notes that "the PCB concentrations in the fish tissue results for the channel catfish and smallmouth bass samples, an unacceptable risk is present even for [...] consumption rates of one meal per month" [28]
Adams County Plant: Westinghouse was fined $5.5 million in 1996 for polluting groundwater in over 100 wells, as well as and other water sources, while operating its Adams County, Pennsylvania plant. Toxic degreasers and other chemicals were released over a 5-year period in the 80s, though the legal battle was not settled until the EPA's involvement. (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette – Nov 12, 1996)
Horseheads Site: Westinghouse is responsible for illegal pollution at what is now known as the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Superfund site in Horseheads, New York. Westinghouse knowingly polluted acres of soil, affecting the safety of a nearby aquifer and wells used by residents. One phase of the clean-up effort describes "Westinghouse Electric Corporation's facility, designated "Disposal Area F" and the "Former Runoff Basin Area," which are contaminated with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and arsenic, will be cleaned up using a combination of soil excavation and soil vapor extraction. At Disposal Area F, the area of contamination is about 0.3 acres. At the Former Runoff Basin Area, the contaminated soils cover approximately 0.7 acres. Disposal of the excavated soils will be at appropriate off-site facilities. The removal of the PAHs and arsenic contamination will protect site workers and employees at the Westinghouse facility and the cleanup of the VOCs will help restore the quality of the Newtown Creek Aquifer." [29]
Sunnyvale Plant: The extent of the pollution at this Sunnyvale, California site has been found to cover the following: "Groundwater and soil are contaminated with PCBs, fuels, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Potential health threats to area residents include accidentally ingesting or coming into direct contact with site contaminants in soil or groundwater." There are municipal drinking water wells within 1/4 mile from this site, and 300,000 people get their drinking water from within three miles of the site.[30]

Sale to Toshiba[edit]
In July 2005 BNFL confirmed it planned to sell Westinghouse, then estimated to be worth $1.8bn (£1bn).[citation needed] However, the bid attracted interest from several companies, including Toshiba, General Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. When the Financial Times reported on January 23, 2006 that Toshiba had won the bid, it valued the company's offer at $5bn (£2.8bn).[31] On February 6, 2006 Toshiba confirmed it was buying Westinghouse Electric Company for $5.4bn and announced it would sell a minority stake to investors. [32] The sale surprised many industry experts who questioned the wisdom of BNFL selling one of the world's largest producers of nuclear reactors shortly before the market for nuclear power was expected to grow substantially; China, the United States and the United Kingdom were all expected to invest heavily in nuclear power.[33] Reasons in favor of a sale were: The commercial risk of the company's business in Asia may have been too high for a company then owned by taxpayers; if Westinghouse won the bid for any new nuclear stations in a UK competition, questions may be raised of favoritism, but if it lost, it might have been seen as a lack of faith in its own technology. Finally, the record of UK governments building nuclear plants had been a commercial disaster.[34]
On October 16, 2006 the acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Company for $5.4 billion was completed, with Toshiba obtaining a 77% share, partners The Shaw Group a 20% share and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. a 3% share.[35] On 13 August 2007 Toshiba sold 10% to Kazatomprom, the national uranium company for the Republic of Kazakhstan, for US$540&#160;million, leaving Toshiba with 67%. Kazatomprom's ownership is entirely passive, with no voting or veto rights or presence on the board of directors.[36]
In September, 2011, Toshiba was reported to be in talks to acquire the Shaw stake[37] and both companies confirmed the story soon thereafter. Shaw CEO James Bernhard said[when?], that Toshiba was paying US$1.6 Bn for the Shaw-owned 20% stake, and that it was the 50% rise in the yen on its yen-denominated debt over five years, which had led it to exercise its sale option. Toshiba said[when?] it was open to, and considering, having other partners invest in the business. The purchase closed in January 2013, and brought Toshiba's share in the company to 87%.[38][39]
In 2015 concerns were expressed that the value of assets and goodwill in Westinghouse were overstated. Following an accounting scandal in which profits were overstated at Toshiba, leading to the CEO resigning, Toshiba stated that the Westinghouse nuclear business was more profitable than at acquisition in 2006.[40][41]
Move to Cranberry Township[edit]
After several years of doing business there, Westinghouse decided to move its world headquarters from the Energy Center in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, to Cranberry Woods in Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania, as reported in a 2007 memo to its employees[42] that stated the main reason was the rapid expansion of the global nuclear industry. Construction began in July 2007, the move lasted from June 2009 to December 2010. The Repair, Replacement and Automation Services (RRAS) business segment moved to Cranberry Township earlier than other business segments to help alleviate space issues at the headquarters in Monroeville and was completed in spring of 2008. As part of this move, Westinghouse piloted the first commuter shuttle running an all-day loop between Monroeville and Cranberry Township. The shuttle ceased operation after Westinghouse formally closed, and sold their Monroeville facility in 2012.

An ignitron is a type of gas-filled tube used as a controlled rectifier and dating from the 1930s. Invented by Joseph Slepian while employed by Westinghouse, Westinghouse was the original manufacturer and owned trademark rights to the name "Ignitron". Ignitrons are closely related to mercury-arc valves but differ in the way the arc is ignited. They function similarly to thyratrons; a triggering pulse to the igniter electrode turns the device "on", allowing a high current to flow between the cathode and anode electrodes. After it is turned on, the current through the anode must be reduced to zero to restore the device to its nonconducting state. They are used to switch high currents in heavy industrial applications.

Construction and operation[edit]




Ignitron rectifiers powering industrial process, 1945


An ignitron is usually a large steel container with a pool of mercury in the bottom that acts as a cathode during operation. A large graphite or refractory metal cylinder, held above the pool by an insulated electrical connection, serves as the anode. An igniting electrode (called the ignitor), made of a refractory semiconductor material such as silicon carbide,[1] is briefly pulsed with a high current to create a puff of electrically conductive mercury plasma. The plasma rapidly bridges the space between the mercury pool and the anode, permitting heavy conduction between the main electrodes. At the surface of the mercury, heating by the resulting arc liberates large numbers of electrons which help to maintain the mercury arc. The mercury surface thus serves as the cathode, and current is normally only in one direction. Once ignited, an ignitron will continue to pass current until either the current is externally interrupted or the voltage applied between cathode and anode is reversed.[2]
Applications[edit]
Ignitrons were long used as high-current rectifiers in major industrial and utility installations where thousands of amperes of AC current must be converted to DC, such as aluminum smelters. Ignitrons were used to control the current in electric welding machines. Large electric motors were also controlled by ignitrons used in gated[clarification needed] fashion, in a manner similar to modern semiconductor devices such as silicon controlled rectifiers and triacs. Many electric locomotives used them in conjunction with transformers to convert high voltage AC from the overhead lines to relatively low voltage DC for the traction motors. The Pennsylvania Railroad's E44 freight locomotives carried on-board ignitrons, as did the Russian ВЛ-60 freight locomotive. For many modern applications, ignitrons have been replaced by solid state alternatives.
Because they are far more resistant to damage due to overcurrent or back-voltage, ignitrons are still manufactured and used in preference to semiconductors in some installations. For example, specially constructed "pulse rated" ignitrons are still used in certain pulsed power applications. These devices can switch hundreds of kiloamperes and hold off as much as 50kV. The anodes in these devices are often fabricated from a refractory metal, usually molybdenum, to handle reverse current during ringing (or oscillatory) discharges without damage. Pulse rated ignitrons usually operate at very low duty cycles. They are often used to switch high energy capacitor banks during electromagnetic forming, electrohydraulic forming, or for emergency short-circuiting of high voltage power sources ("crowbar" switching).

Comparison with mercury-arc valve[edit]
Although the basic principles of how the arc is formed, along with many aspects of construction, are very similar to other types of mercury-arc valves, ignitrons differ from other mercury-arc valves in that the arc is ignited each time a conduction cycle is started, and then extinguished when the current falls below a critical threshold.
In other types of mercury-arc valve, the arc is ignited just once when the valve is first energised, and thereafter remains permanently established, alternating between the main anode(s) and a low-power auxiliary anode or keep-alive circuit. Moreover, control grids are required in order to adjust the timing of the start of conduction.
The action of igniting the arc at a controlled time, each cycle, allows the ignitron to dispense with the auxiliary anode and control grids required by other mercury-arc valves. However, a disadvantage is that the ignition electrode must be positioned very accurately, just barely touching the surface of the mercury pool, which means that ignitrons must be installed very accurately within a few degrees of an upright position.

Mathematics and the Imagination is a book published in New York by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1940. The authors are Edward Kasner and James R. Newman. The illustrator Rufus Isaacs provided 169 figures. It rapidly became a best-seller and received several glowing reviews. Special publicity has been awarded it since it introduced the term googol for 10100, and googolplex for 10googol. The book includes nine chapters, an annotated bibliography of 45 titles, and an index in its 380 pages.

Reviews[edit]
According to I. Bernard Cohen, "it is the best account of modern mathematics that we have", and is "written in a graceful style, combining clarity of exposition with good humor". According to T. A. Ryan’s review, the book "is not as superficial as one might expect a book at the popular level to be. For instance, the description of the invention of the term googol ... is a very serious attempt to show how misused is the term infinite when applied to large and finite numbers." By 1941 G. Waldo Dunnington could note the book had become a best-seller. "Apparently it has succeeded in communicating to the layman something of the pleasure experienced by the creative mathematician in difficult problem solving."
Contents[edit]
The introduction notes (p xiii) "Science, particularly mathematics, ... appears to be building the one permanent and stable edifice in an age where all others are either crumbling or being blown to bits." The authors affirm (p xiv) "It has been our aim, ... to show by its very diversity something of the character of mathematics, of its bold, untrammelled spirit, of how, both as an art and science, it has continued to lead the creative faculties beyond even imagination and intuition."
In chapter one, "New names for old", they explain why mathematics is the science that uses easy words for hard ideas. They note (p 5) "many amusing ambiguities arise. For instance, the word function probably expresses the most important idea in the whole history of mathematics. Also, the theory of rings is much more recent than the theory of groups. It is found in most of the new books on algebra, and has nothing to do with either matrimony or bells. Page 7 introduces the Jordan curve theorem. In discussing the Problem of Apollonius, they mention that Edmond Laguerre's solution considered circles with orientation.(p 13) In presenting radicals, they say "The symbol for radical is not the hammer and sickle, but a sign three or four centuries old, and the idea of a mathematical radical is even older than that."(p 16) "Ruffini and Abel showed that equations of the fifth degree could not be solved by radicals."(p 17) (Abel-Ruffini theorem)
Chapter 2 "Beyond Googol" treats infinite sets. The distinction is made between a countable set and an uncountable set. Further, the characteristic property of infinite sets is given: an infinite class may be in 1:1 correspondence with a proper subset (p 57), so that "an infinite class is no greater than some of its parts" (p 43). In addition to introducing Aleph numbers the authors cite Lewis Carrol’s The Hunting of the Snark, where instructions are given to avoid boojums when snark hunting. They say "The infinite may be boojum too." (p 61)
Chapter 3 is "Pie (π, i, e) Transcendental and Imaginary". To motivate e (mathematical constant), they discuss first compound interest and then continuous compounding. "No other mathematical constant, not even π, is more closely connected with human affairs" (p 86). "[e] has played an integral part in helping mathematicians describe and predict what is for man the most important of all natural phenomena – that of growth." The exponential function, y = ex ... "is the only function of x with the rate of change with respect to x equal to the function itself." (p 87) The authors define the Gauss plane and describe the action of multiplication by i as rotation through 90°. They address Euler's identity, i.e. the expression eπ i&#160;+&#160;1&#160;=&#160;0, indicating that the venerable Benjamin Peirce called it "absolutely paradoxical". A note of idealism is then expressed: "When there is so much humility and so much vision everywhere, society will be governed by science and not its clever people." (pp 103,4)
Chapter 4 is "Assorted Geometries, Plane and Fancy". Both Non-Euclidean geometry and four-dimensional space are discussed. The authors say (p 112) "Among our most cherished convictions, none is more precious than our beliefs about space and time, yet is more difficult to explain."
In the final pages the authors approach the question, "What is mathematics?" They say it is a "sad fact that it is easier to be clever than clear." The answer is not as easy as defining biology. "[I]n mathematics we have a universal language, valid, useful, intelligible everywhere in place and time ..." Finally, "Austere and imperious as logic, it is still sufficiently sensitive and flexible to meet each new need. Yet this vast edifice rests on the simplest and most primitive foundations, is wrought by imagination and logic out of a handful of childish rules." (p 358)

The Nimitz-class supercarriers are a class of ten nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in service with the United States Navy. The lead ship of the class is named for World War II United States Pacific Fleet commander Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the U.S. Navy's last fleet admiral. With an overall length of 1,092&#160;ft (333&#160;m) and full-load displacements of over 100,000 long tons,[1] they have been the largest warships built and in service,[4] although they are being eclipsed by the upcoming Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. Instead of the gas turbines or diesel-electric systems used for propulsion on many modern warships, the carriers use two A4W pressurized water reactors which drive four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots (56&#160;km/h) and maximum power of around 260,000&#160;shp (190&#160;MW). As a result of the use of nuclear power, the ships are capable of operating for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years. They are categorized as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and are numbered with consecutive hull numbers between CVN-68 and CVN-77.[Note 1]
All ten carriers were constructed by Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Virginia. USS&#160;Nimitz, the lead ship of the class, was commissioned on 3 May 1975, and USS&#160;George H.W. Bush, the tenth and last of the class, was commissioned on 10 January 2009. Since the 1970s, Nimitz-class carriers have participated in many conflicts and operations across the world, including Operation Eagle Claw in Iran, the Gulf War, and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The angled flight decks of the carriers use a CATOBAR arrangement to operate aircraft, with steam catapults and arrestor wires for launch and recovery. As well as speeding up flight deck operations, this allows for a much wider variety of aircraft than with the STOVL arrangement used on smaller carriers. An embarked carrier air wing consisting of up to around 90 aircraft is normally deployed on board. After the retirement of the F-14 Tomcat, the air wings' strike fighters are primarily F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets and F/A-18A+ and F/A-18C Hornets. In addition to their aircraft, the vessels carry short-range defensive weaponry for anti-aircraft warfare and missile defense.

Description[edit]
The Nimitz-class carriers have an overall length of 1,092&#160;ft (333&#160;m) and a full-load displacement of about 100,000–104,000 long tons (102,000–106,000&#160;t).[5] They have a beam at the waterline of 135&#160;ft (41&#160;m), and the maximum width of their flight decks is 251&#160;feet 10&#160;inches (76.76&#160;m) to 257&#160;feet 3&#160;inches (78.41&#160;m) (depending on the variant). The ships' companies can number up to 3,200, not including an air wing of 2,480.[6]
Design[edit]

The Nimitz-class aircraft carriers were ordered to supplement the aircraft carriers of the Kitty Hawk class and Enterprise class, maintaining the strength and capability of the U.S. Navy after the older carriers were decommissioned.[7] The ships were designed to be improvements on previous U.S. aircraft carriers, in particular the Enterprise and Forrestal-class supercarriers, although the arrangement of the ships is relatively similar to that of the Kitty Hawk class.[8] Among other design improvements, the two reactors on Nimitz-class carriers take up less space than the eight reactors used on Enterprise. Along with a more generally improved design, this means that Nimitz-class carriers can carry 90% more aviation fuel and 50% more ordnance when compared to the Forrestal class.
The U.S. Navy has stated that the carriers could withstand three times the damage sustained by the Essex class inflicted by Japanese air attacks during World War II.[3] The hangars on the ships are divided into three fire bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire. This addition has been present on U.S. aircraft carriers since World War II, after the fires caused by Kamikaze attacks.[9]
The first ships were designed around the time of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as they were used to send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was partly as a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.[10]
A major purpose of the ships was initially to support the U.S. military during the Cold War, and they were designed with capabilities for that role, including using nuclear power instead of oil for greater endurance when deployed in blue water, and the ability to make adjustments to the carriers' weapons systems on the basis of new intelligence and technological developments.[11] They were initially categorized only as attack carriers, but ships have been constructed with anti-submarine capabilities since USS&#160;Carl Vinson.[12][13] As a result, the ships and their aircraft are now able to participate in a wide range of operations, which can include sea and air blockades, mine laying, and missile strikes on land, air and sea.[14]
Because of a design flaw, ships of this class have inherent lists to starboard when under combat loads that exceed the capability of their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent on some of the more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.[5][15]
Construction[edit]
All ten Nimitz-class aircraft carriers were constructed between 1968 and 2006 at Newport News Shipbuilding Company, in Newport News, Virginia, in the largest drydock in the western hemisphere, dry dock 12, now 2,172 feet (662&#160;m) long after a recent expansion.
Since USS&#160;Theodore Roosevelt, the aircraft carriers were manufactured in modular construction (USS George H.W. Bush was constructed from 161 'super-lift' modules). This means that whole sections could be welded together with plumbing and electrical equipment already fitted, improving efficiency. Using gantry cranes, the modules were lifted into the dry dock and welded. In the case of the bow section, these can weigh over 1,500,000 pounds (680&#160;t).[16][17][18] This method was originally developed by Ingalls Shipbuilding and increases the rate of work because much of the fitting out does not have to be carried out within the confines of the already finished hull.[19]
The total cost of construction for each ship was around $4.5 billion.[Note 2][7]
Propulsion[edit]




One of 4 propellers of George Washington


All ships of the class are powered by two A4W nuclear reactors, kept in separate compartments. They power four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over 30 knots (56&#160;km/h) and maximum power of 260,000&#160;bhp (190&#160;MW).[3] The reactors produce heat through nuclear fission which heats water. This is then passed through four turbines (manufactured by General Electric) which are shared by the two reactors. The turbines power the four bronze screws, each with a diameter of 25 feet (7.6&#160;m) and a weight of 66,000 pounds (30&#160;t). Behind these are the two rudders which are 29 feet (8.8&#160;m) high and 22 feet (6.7&#160;m) long, and each weigh 110,000 pounds (50&#160;t).[20] The Nimitz-class ships constructed since USS&#160;Ronald Reagan also have bulbous bows in order to improve speed and fuel efficiency by reducing Wave-making resistance.[21] As a result of the use of nuclear power, the ships are capable of operating continuously for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years.[20]
Armament and protection[edit]

In addition to the aircraft carried on board, the ships carry defensive equipment for use against missiles and hostile aircraft. These consist of either three or four NATO RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile launchers designed for defense against aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as either three or four 20&#160;mm Phalanx CIWS missile defense cannon. USS&#160;Ronald Reagan has none of these, having been built with the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile system, two of which have also been installed on USS&#160;Nimitz and USS&#160;George Washington. These will be installed on the other ships as they return for Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH).[3][15] Since USS Theodore Roosevelt, the carriers have been constructed with 2.5&#160;in (64&#160;mm) Kevlar armor over vital spaces, and earlier ships have been retrofitted with it: Nimitz in 1983–1984, Eisenhower from 1985–1987 and Vinson in 1989.[2][22]
The other countermeasures the ships use are four Sippican SRBOC (super rapid bloom off-board chaff) six-barrel MK36 decoy launchers, which deploy infrared Flare (countermeasure) and chaff to disrupt the sensors of incoming missiles; an SSTDS torpedo defense system; and an AN/SLQ-25 Nixie torpedo countermeasures system. The carriers also use AN/SLQ-32(V) Radar jamming and deception systems to detect and disrupt hostile radar signals in addition to the electronic warfare capabilities of some of the aircraft on board.[23][24]
The presence of nuclear weapons on board U.S. aircraft carriers since the end of the Cold War has neither been confirmed nor denied by the U.S. government. As a result of this, as well as concerns over the safety of nuclear power, the presence of a U.S. aircraft carrier in a foreign port has occasionally provoked protest from local people, for example when USS Nimitz docked in Chennai, India, in 2007. At that time, the Strike Group commander Rear Admiral John Terence Blake stated that: "The U.S. policy is that we do not routinely deploy nuclear weapons on board Nimitz."[25][26]
Carrier air wing[edit]

Main article: Carrier air wing
In order for a carrier to deploy, it must embark one of ten Carrier Air Wings (CVW).[Note 3] The carriers can accommodate a maximum of 130 F/A-18 Hornets[27] or 85–90 aircraft of different types, but current numbers are typically 64 aircraft. Although the air wings are integrated with the operation of the carriers they are deployed to, they are nevertheless regarded as a separate entity. As well as the aircrew, the air wings are also made up of support personnel involved in roles including maintenance, aircraft and ordnance handling and emergency procedures. Each person on the flight deck wears color-coded clothing to make his role easily identifiable.
A typical carrier air wing can include 12–14 F/A-18E or F Super Hornets as strike fighters; two squadrons of 10–12 F/A-18C Hornets, with one of these often provided by the U.S. Marine Corps (VMFA), also as strike fighters; 4–6 EA-6B Prowlers or EA-18G Growlers for electronic warfare; 4–6 E-2C or D Hawkeyes for airborne early warning (AEW), C-2 Greyhounds used for logistics (to be replaced by MV-22 Ospreys); and a Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron of 6–8 SH-60F and HH-60H Seahawks. Aircraft that have previously operated from Nimitz-class carriers include F-4 Phantoms, RA-5C Vigilantes, RF-8G Crusaders, F-14 Tomcats, S-3 Vikings, A-7 Corsair II and A-6E Intruder aircraft.[28]

Flight deck and aircraft facilities[edit]

The flight deck is angled at nine degrees, which allows for aircraft to be launched and recovered simultaneously. This angle of the flight deck was reduced slightly in relation to previous carriers, as the current design improves the air flow around the carrier.[10] Four steam catapults are used to launch fixed-wing aircraft, and four arrestor wires are used for recovery. The two newest carriers, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, have only three arrestor wires each, as the fourth was used infrequently on earlier ships and was therefore deemed unnecessary. This CATOBAR arrangement allows for faster launching and recovery as well as a much wider range of aircraft that can be used on board compared with smaller aircraft carriers, most of which use a simpler STOVL arrangement without catapults or arrestor wires. The ship's aircraft operations are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangars below. These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire.[9]
Strike groups[edit]
Main article: Carrier strike group

When an aircraft carrier deploys, it takes a Strike Group, made up of several other warships and supply vessels which allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the Nimitz class is made up only of short range defensive weapons, used as a last line of defense against enemy missiles and aircraft. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and also protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may include, in addition to an aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including frigates, guided missile cruisers and guided missile destroyers (used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare); one or two attack submarines (for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines); and an ammunition, oiler, and supply ship of Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support.[29] The precise structure and numbers of each type of ship can vary between groups depending on the objectives of the deployment.[30]
Design differences within the class[edit]
While the designs of the final seven ships (beginning with USS&#160;Theodore Roosevelt) are slightly different from those of the earlier ships, the U.S. Navy considers all ten carriers as a single class.[31] When the older carriers come in for Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), their nuclear power plants are refueled and they are upgraded to the standards of the later carriers. Other modifications may be performed to update the ships' equipment.[15][32] The ships were initially classified only as attack carriers but have been constructed with anti-submarine capabilities since USS Carl Vinson. These improvements include better radar systems and facilities which enable the ships to operate aircraft in a more effective Anti-submarine warfare role, including the fitting of common undersea picture (CUP) technology which uses sonar to allow for better assessment of the threat from submarines.[12] The changes included better support for S-3 Viking ASW patrol planes and SH-60F Seahawk helicopters with dipping sonar systems.

USS Theodore Roosevelt and later carriers have slight structural differences from the earlier Nimitz carriers such as improved protection for ordnance stored in their magazines. Other improvements include upgraded flight deck ballistic protection, first installed on USS George Washington, and the high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA-100) used for constructing ships starting with USS John C. Stennis.[8][33] More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve safety for both crew members and aircraft.[34][35]
The final carrier of the class, USS George H.W. Bush, was designed as a "transition ship" from the Nimitz class to the replacement Gerald R. Ford&#160;class. Bush incorporates new technologies including improved propeller and bulbous bow designs, a reduced Radar cross-section and electronic and environmental upgrades.[36][37] As a result, the ship's cost was $6.2&#160;billion. The earlier Nimitz class ships each cost around $4.5 billion.[38] To lower costs, some new technologies and design features were also incorporated into USS&#160;Ronald Reagan, the previous carrier, including a redesigned island.[39]

Service history[edit]
1975–1989[edit]
One of the first major operations in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by USS Nimitz in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean in response to the taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran.[14] Although initially part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet,[53] Eisenhower relieved Nimitz in this operation after her service in the Mediterranean Sea.[40] Nimitz conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in what became known as the Gulf of Sidra incident.[54] In 1987, Vinson participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in the Bering Sea,[55] and Nimitz provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.[56]
1990–2000[edit]

The two most significant deployments the Nimitz class was involved in during the 1990s were the Gulf War and its aftermath, and Operation Southern Watch in southern Iraq. All active vessels were engaged in both of these to some extent, with Operation Southern Watch continuing until 2003.[57] However, most carriers in operation in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm played supporting roles, with only Roosevelt playing an active part in combat operations. Throughout the 1990s and more recently, Nimitz-class carriers have been deployed as part of humanitarian missions. While deployed in the Gulf War, Lincoln was diverted to the Indian Ocean to participate alongside 22 other ships in Operation Fiery Vigil, evacuating civilians following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo on Luzon Island in the Philippines. In October 1993, Lincoln deployed to Somalia to assist UN humanitarian operations there, spending four weeks flying patrols over the area around Mogadishu while supporting U.S. troops during Operation Restore Hope. The same ship also participated in Operation Vigilant Sentinel in the Persian Gulf in 1995.[47] Roosevelt flew patrols in support of the Kurds over northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort in 1991. In 1996, George Washington played a peacekeeping role in Operation Decisive Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina.[58] In 1999, Roosevelt was called to the Ionian Sea to support Operation Allied Force alongside other NATO militaries.[59]
2001–present[edit]

Harry S. Truman's maiden deployment was in November 2000. The carrier's air wing flew 869 combat sorties in support of Operation Southern Watch, including a strike on Iraqi air defense sites on 16 February 2001, in response to Iraqi surface-to-air missile fire against United Nations coalition forces.[60]

After the 11 September attacks, Carl Vinson and Theodore Roosevelt were among the first warships to participate in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. Carl Vinson sailed towards the Persian Gulf intending to support Operation Southern Watch in July 2001. This changed in response to the attacks, and the ship changed course to travel towards the North Arabian Sea, where she launched the first airstrikes in support of the operation on 7 October 2001.[61] Following the attacks, John C. Stennis and George Washington participated in Operation Noble Eagle, carrying out homeland security operations off the West Coast of the United States. All active ships have been involved to some extent in Iraq and Afghanistan since that time. This included the invasion in 2003, as well as providing subsequent support for Operation Iraqi Freedom since then.[62]
The carriers have also provided aid after natural disasters; in 2005, Abraham Lincoln supported Operation Unified Assistance in Indonesia after the December 2004 tsunami,[63] and Truman provided aid after Hurricane Katrina later in 2005.[64] The Reagan Carrier Strike Group performed humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in the Philippines in June 2008 after Typhoon Fengshen, which killed hundreds from the central island regions and the main island of Luzon.[65] In January 2010 Vinson operated off Haiti, providing aid and drinking water to earthquake survivors as part of the U.S. led Operation Unified Response, alongside other major warships and hospital ship Comfort.[66] In 2013, the USS Nimitz and other Nimitz class carriers are near Syria.[citation needed]
Refueling Complex Overhaul[edit]
Main article: Refueling and Overhaul
In order to refuel their nuclear power plants, the carriers each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This is also the most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up to the standards of the newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to the standards of the newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults and combat systems as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt, which began in 2009, will reportedly cost US$2.4&#160;billion.[67][68][69] Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of the nuclear power plants.[70]
Symbolic and diplomatic roles[edit]

Because of their status as the largest warships in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not just in terms of a deterrent to an enemy, but often as a diplomatic tool, in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can take place either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operating of the carrier and to interact with its senior officers,[71] or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999,[72] or other deployments involving training, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.[73][74]
Accidents and incidents[edit]
As on most large warships, there have been several incidents involving the death or injury of one or more crew members, although most have involved freak accidents or failures, such as a man overboard as a result of poor weather. One of the highest-profile incidents was on 26 May 1981, when an EA-6B Prowler crashed on the flight deck of Nimitz, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others.[14][75] Forensic testing of the personnel involved showed that several tested positive for marijuana. While this in itself was not found to have directly caused the crash, the findings of the investigation prompted the introduction of mandatory drug testing of all service personnel.[76][77]
In cases of ditched aircraft, pilots have been able to eject safely in several cases. However, fatal aircraft crashes have occurred; in 1994, Lt. Kara Hultgreen, the first female F-14 Tomcat pilot, was killed while attempting to land on board Abraham Lincoln during a training exercise.[47]
Fires have also caused damage to the ships; in May 2008, while rotating through to her new homeport at Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan, George Washington suffered a serious fire which cost $70&#160;million in repairs, injured 37 sailors and led to the ship undergoing three months of repairs at San Diego; this led to its having to miss the 2008 RIMPAC exercises and delayed the final withdrawal from service of USS&#160;Kitty Hawk. The fire was caused by unauthorized smoking in an area near improperly stored flammable refrigerant.[78][79][80]
Future[edit]

Nimitz-class carriers were designed to have a 50-year service life.[81] At the end of the service life, ships will be decommissioned. This process will first take place on Nimitz and is estimated to cost from $750 to $900&#160;million. This compares with an estimate of $53&#160;million for a conventionally powered carrier. Most of the difference in cost is attributed to the deactivation of the nuclear power plants and safe removal of radioactive material and other contaminated equipment.[82] A new class of carriers, the Gerald R. Ford class, is being constructed to replace previous vessels after decommissioning. Ten of these are expected, and the first will enter service in 2016 to replace the previous USS Enterprise (CVN-65). Most of the rest of these new carriers are to replace the oldest Nimitz ships as they reach the end of their service lives.[83] The new carriers will have a similar design to George H.W. Bush (using an almost identical hull shape) and technological and structural improvements.[84]

The Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region (German: Metropolregion Rhein-Ruhr) is the largest metropolitan region in Germany with over 11 million inhabitants. It is of polycentric nature and the only megacity in Germany. It covers an area of 7,110 square kilometers and lies entirely within the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region spreads from Dortmund-Bochum-Essen-Duisburg (Ruhr Area) in the north, to the urban areas of the cities of Mönchengladbach, Düsseldorf (the state capital), Wuppertal, Leverkusen, Cologne (the region's largest and Germany's fourth largest city), and Bonn in the south. The location of the Rhine-Ruhr at the heart of the European blue banana makes it well connected to other major European cities and metropolitan areas like the Randstad, the Flemish Diamond and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region.
The metropolitan area is named after the Rhine and Ruhr rivers, which are the regions's defining geographical features and historically its economic backbone.

Subdivisions[edit]
The largest cities in the Rhine-Ruhr area are Cologne, with over 1 million inhabitants, followed by Düsseldorf, Dortmund and Essen, which each have a population of over 500,000.
There are many different sub-definitions of what belongs to the Rhine-Ruhr area, but the metropolitan area itself has officially defined borders with Hamm in the east, Mönchengladbach in the west and Bonn in the south and the small city Wesel as its northernmost point. The northern border is similar to the border of the Ruhr Area.
The table below shows an unofficial summary of regions. In the official definition the metropolitan area is much smaller.

Economy[edit]




Deutsche Telekom headquarters in Bonn


Historically, most of the Ruhr area was for the most part characterized by heavy industry since the age of industrialisation in the late 19th and early 20th century. Since the Middle Ages, Cologne, Dortmund and other cities were important regional trading cities, but during the 19th century the city of Düsseldorf grew to become the administrative center of the region and since 1945 its political capital.
Today, the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region accounts for roughly 15% of the GDP of the German economy, which would place it as the 3rd largest GRP of metropolitan area in the European Union and the 16th largest GDP in the world. Despite this size, the Rhine-Ruhr region as a whole often lacks international competitiveness from the lack of a unified presentation, in which cities and urban areas within it, often pursue a separate investment policy against each other.[17]
From within, Düsseldorf and Cologne are by far the largest economic centers,[18] with specialisation in financial/high tech and insurance/multi media services respectively. Other major economic centers are Bonn, Dortmund and Essen. The region is home to twelve[19] Fortune Global 500 companies, among them E.ON AG, Düsseldorf, Deutsche Post AG, Bonn, Metro AG, Düsseldorf, Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn, ThyssenKrupp AG, Essen/Duisburg, RWE AG, Essen, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Franz Haniel &amp; Cie. GmbH, Duisburg, Evonik Industries, Essen, Hochtief AG, Essen and the Henkel Group, Düsseldorf.
Transportation[edit]

The metro area boasts the two international airports of Cologne/Bonn and Düsseldorf International and several regional/national airports like Dortmund Airport, Düsseldorf-Mönchengladbach Airport and Weeze Airport. The city of Cologne is also connected to Frankfurt Airport via the 1 hour Cologne–Frankfurt high-speed rail line.

North Rhine-Westphalia has the densest network of Autobahns in Germany and the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr is the region's rapid transit system which interconnects all cities and their respective local U- and S-Bahn systems (Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn).
Duisburg Port (Duisport) and Dortmund Port are large industrial inland ports and serve as hubs along the Rhine and the German inland water transport system.
Tourism[edit]
Events[edit]




Signal Iduna Park, the stadium of Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, is the largest stadium in Germany


The region is host to numerous large events, comprising fun fairs and cultural events like the Cologne and Düsseldorf carnivals (carnival is however a public event in almost all cities and towns of the area), the Cologne Comedy Festival, Ruhrfestspiele Recklinghausen, and the RuhrTriennale, as well as gamescom and other trade fairs at koelnmesse - Cologne Trade Fair and Messe Düsseldorf. With a capacity of up to 20,000 people, the Lanxess Arena and Westfalenhallen are amongst the largest indoor arenas in Germany.
The region is home to a total of 13 Bundesliga football clubs, of which five are active in the season of 2012/13. The most successful among them are Borussia Dortmund, Borussia Mönchengladbach, 1. FC Köln, FC Schalke 04 and Bayer 04 Leverkusen. Signal Iduna Park, the stadium of Borussia Dortmund, is the biggest stadium in Germany.
Landmarks[edit]




The Zeche Zollverein coal mine


Several tourist destinations within the region attract over 12 million tourists per year. Cologne Cathedral, Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces at Brühl and the Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex at Essen are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Other sights include Schloss Benrath in Düsseldorf and several anchor points of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.
Museums[edit]
NRW Forum, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Museum Koenig, Museum Ludwig, Romano-Germanic Museum, Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Neanderthal Museum, Museum Folkwang, Museum Ostwall, Lehmbruck Museum, German Mining Museum and Deutsches Museum Bonn are some of the most famous examples.
Education[edit]
The Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region is home to nine universities and over 30 partly postgraduate colleges, with a total of over 300.000 students. The largest and oldest university is the University of Cologne (Universität zu Köln), originally founded in 1388 AD. Other universities include:

the University of Bochum,
the University of Bonn,
the German Sport University Cologne,
the Dortmund University of Technology,
the University of Duisburg-Essen,
the University of Düsseldorf,
the FernUniversität Hagen and
the University of Wuppertal.

			Axiom of infinity
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				In axiomatic set theory and the branches of mathematics and philosophy that use it, the axiom of infinity is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. It guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers. It was first published by Ernst Zermelo as part of his set theory in 1908.[1]

Formal statement[edit]
In the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads:



In words, there is a set I (the set which is postulated to be infinite), such that the empty set is in I and such that whenever any x is a member of I, the set formed by taking the union of x with its singleton {x} is also a member of I. Such a set is sometimes called an inductive set.
Interpretation and consequences[edit]
This axiom is closely related to the standard construction of the naturals in set theory, in which the successor of x is defined as x ∪ {x}. If x is a set, then it follows from the other axioms of set theory that this successor is also a uniquely defined set. Successors are used to define the usual set-theoretic encoding of the natural numbers. In this encoding, zero is the empty set:

0 = {}.

The number 1 is the successor of 0:

1 = 0 ∪ {0} = {} ∪ {0} = {0}.

Likewise, 2 is the successor of 1:

2 = 1 ∪ {1} = {0} ∪ {1} = {0,1},

and so on. A consequence of this definition is that every natural number is equal to the set of all preceding natural numbers.
This construction forms the natural numbers. However, the other axioms are insufficient to prove the existence of the set of all natural numbers. Therefore its existence is taken as an axiom—the axiom of infinity. This axiom asserts that there is a set I that contains 0 and is closed under the operation of taking the successor; that is, for each element of I, the successor of that element is also in I.
Thus the essence of the axiom is:

There is a set, I, that includes all the natural numbers.

The axiom of infinity is also one of the von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms.
Extracting the natural numbers from the infinite set[edit]
The infinite set I is a superset of the natural numbers. To show that the natural numbers themselves constitute a set, the axiom schema of specification can be applied to remove unwanted elements, leaving the set N of all natural numbers. This set is unique by the axiom of extensionality.
To extract the natural numbers, we need a definition of which sets are natural numbers. The natural numbers can be defined in a way which does not assume any axioms except the axiom of extensionality and the axiom of induction—a natural number is either zero or a successor and each of its elements is either zero or a successor of another of its elements. In formal language, the definition says:



Or, even more formally:







Alternative method[edit]
An alternative method is the following. Let  be the formula that says `x is inductive'; i.e. . Informally, what we will do is take the intersection of all inductive sets. More formally, we wish to prove the existence of a unique set  such that

 (*)

For existence, we will use the Axiom of Infinity combined with the Axiom schema of specification. Let  be an inductive set guaranteed by the Axiom of Infinity. Then we use the Axiom Schema of Specification to define our set  - i.e.  is the set of all elements of  which happen also to be elements of every other inductive set. This clearly satisfies the hypothesis of (*), since if , then  is in every inductive set, and if  is in every inductive set, it is in particular in , so it must also be in .
For uniqueness, first note that any set which satisfies (*) is itself inductive, since 0 is in all inductive sets, and if an element  is in all inductive sets, then by the inductive property so is its successor. Thus if there were another set  which satisfied (*) we would have that  since  is inductive, and  since  is inductive. Thus . Let  denote this unique element.
This definition is convenient because the principle of induction immediately follows: If  is inductive, then also , so that .
Both these methods produce systems which satisfy the axioms of second-order arithmetic, since the axiom of power set allows us to quantify over the power set of , as in second-order logic. Thus they both completely determine isomorphic systems, and since they are isomorphic under the identity map, they must in fact be equal.
Independence[edit]
The axiom of infinity cannot be derived from the rest of the axioms of ZFC, if these other axioms are consistent. Nor can it be refuted, if all of ZFC is consistent.
Indeed, using the Von Neumann universe, we can make a model of the axioms where the axiom of infinity is replaced by its negation. It is , the class of hereditarily finite sets, with the inherited element relation. If allowed, the empty domain also satisfies the axioms of this modified theory, as all of them are universally quantified, and thus trivially satisfied if no set exists.
The cardinality of the set of natural numbers, aleph null (), has many of the properties of a large cardinal. Thus the axiom of infinity is sometimes regarded as the first large cardinal axiom, and conversely large cardinal axioms are sometimes called stronger axioms of infinity.

General Dynamics Electric Boat[1] (GDEB) is a subsidiary of General Dynamics Corporation. It has been the primary builder of submarines for the United States Navy for more than 100 years.
The company's main facilities are a shipyard in Groton, Connecticut, a hull-fabrication and outfitting facility in Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and a design and engineering facility in New London, Connecticut.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1899 by Isaac Rice as the Electric Boat Company to build John Philip Holland's submersible designs, which were developed at Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Holland VI was the first submarine that this shipyard built, later renamed USS&#160;Holland&#160;(SS-1). On 11 April 1900, it became the first modern submarine to be purchased and commissioned into the United States Navy. The success of Holland VI created a demand for follow-up models (A-class or Plunger&#160;class) that began with the prototype submersible Fulton built at Electric Boat (EB). Some foreign navies were interested in John Holland's latest submarine designs, and so purchased the rights to build them under licensing contracts through the Electric Boat Company, and these included Great Britain's Royal Navy, Japan's Imperial Japanese Navy, Russia's Imperial Russian Navy, and the Netherlands' Royal Netherlands Navy.
During the World War I era, the company and its subsidiaries (notably Elco) built 85 submarines (via subcontractors) and 722 submarine chasers for the US Navy, and 580 80-foot motor launches for the British Royal Navy.[2] After the war, the US Navy did not order another submarine from the company until Cuttlefish in 1931.[3] During World War II, the company built 74 submarines, while Elco built nearly 400 PT boats.[4] Electric Boat ranked 77th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[5]
In 1952, Electric Boat was reorganized as General Dynamics Corporation under John Jay Hopkins. General Dynamics acquired Convair the following year, and the holding company assumed the "General Dynamics" name, with the submarine building operation reverting to the "Electric Boat" name.[6]
Electric Boat built the first nuclear submarine USS&#160;Nautilus, which was launched in January 1954, and the first ballistic missile submarine USS&#160;George Washington in 1959. Submarines of the Ohio-, Los Angeles-, Seawolf-, and Virginia-classes were also constructed by Electric Boat.
In 2002, Electric Boat conducted preservation work on the Nautilus, preparing her for her berth at the US Navy Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, where she now resides as a museum. Electric Boat's first submarine Holland was scrapped in 1932.
Electric Boat overhauls and undertakes repair work on fast attack class boats. Electric Boat built the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines and Seawolf-class submarines, as well as others. However, most of the work done in the shipyard today is focused on construction of the Virginia-class, notably the new Block III evolution.

The Lower Rhine region in North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany


The Lower Rhine region or Niederrhein is a region around the Lower Rhine section of the river Rhine in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany between approximately Oberhausen and Krefeld in the East and the Dutch border around Kleve in the West. As the region can be defined either geographically, linguistically, culturally, or by political, economic and traffic relations throughout the centuries, as well as by more recent political subdivisions, its precise borders are disputable and occasionally may be seen as extending beyond the Dutch border. Yet, while the Dutch half of the Lower Rhine geographic area is called Nederrijn in Dutch, it is a separate territory from the adjoining German Niederrhein region, despite both names are a translation of the other.
A cultural bond of the German Lower Rhine region is its Low Franconian language, specifically the Cleverlander dialect (Dutch: Kleverlands, German: Kleverländisch), which is closely related to the Dutch dialects of South Guelderish just across the border and East Bergish to the southeast. In the region's southern portion is spoken Low Bergish, which is the easternmost dialect of Limburgish. Other typicalities of the area include the predominantly Catholic background as well as the Rhenish Carnival tradition.
The area basically covers the districts of Cleves, Wesel, Viersen and Neuss as well as the independent cities of Duisburg, Mönchengladbach and Krefeld. While disputable, Oberhausen and Düsseldorf may also be seen as part of the Lower Rhine region.
The Lower Rhine region's landscape is mostly flat green grass land with wide views of the horizon. Sights include the historic town centers of Cleves and Xanten, as well as the latter town's Roman archeological museum, the castle "Schloss Moyland" in Bedburg-Hau or the Catholic pilgrimage town of Kevelaer.[1]

Kenneth Kunen


Herbert Kenneth Kunen (born August 2, 1943) is an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison[1] who works in set theory and its applications to various areas of mathematics, such as set-theoretic topology and measure theory. He also works on non-associative algebraic systems, such as loops, and uses computer software, such as the Otter theorem prover, to derive theorems in these areas.
Kunen showed that if there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j:L→L of the constructible universe, then 0# exists. He proved the consistency of a normal, -saturated ideal on  from the consistency of the existence of a huge cardinal. He introduced the method of iterated ultrapowers, with which he proved that if  is a measurable cardinal with  or  is a strongly compact cardinal then there is an inner model of set theory with  many measurable cardinals. He proved Kunen's inconsistency theorem showing the impossibility of a nontrivial elementary embedding , which had been suggested as a large cardinal assumption (a Reinhardt cardinal).
Away from the area of large cardinals, Kunen is known for intricate forcing and combinatorial constructions. He proved that it is consistent that the Martin Axiom first fails at a singular cardinal and constructed under CH a compact L-space supporting a nonseparable measure. He also showed that  has no increasing chain of length  in the standard Cohen model where the continuum is . The concept of a Jech–Kunen tree is named after him and Thomas Jech.
Kunen received his Ph.D. in 1968 from Stanford University,[2] where he was supervised by Dana Scott.

RIM-7 Sea Sparrow is a US ship-borne short-range anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapon system, primarily intended for defense against anti-ship missiles. The system was developed in the early 1960s from the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile as a lightweight "point-defense" weapon that could be retrofitted to existing ships as quickly as possible, often in place of existing gun-based anti-aircraft weapons. In this incarnation it was a very simple system, guided by a manually aimed radar illuminator. Since its introduction, the Sea Sparrow has undergone significant development and now resembles the AIM-7 only in general form; it is larger, faster and includes a new seeker and a launch system suitable for vertical launch from modern warships. Fifty years after its development, the Sea Sparrow remains an important part of a layered air defense system, providing a short/medium-range component especially useful against sea-skimming missiles.

History[edit]
Background[edit]
High-speed jet aircraft flying at low altitudes presented a serious threat to naval forces in the late 1950s. Approaching under the local horizon of the ships, the aircraft would suddenly appear at relatively close ranges, giving the ships only seconds to respond before the aircraft dropped their payloads and withdrew. This gave the aircraft an enormous advantage over earlier weapons such as dive bombers or torpedo bombers, whose low speed allowed them to be attacked with some effectiveness by anti-aircraft guns. The advantage was so great that when the Royal Navy was faced by the threat of the new Soviet Sverdlov class cruiser, they responded in a non-linear fashion by introducing the Blackburn Buccaneer aircraft to attack them.[1]
Further improving the capabilities of aircraft against ships were a variety of precision-guided weapons. Early designs were first used in World War II with manually controlled weapons such as the Fritz X, and evolving into semi-autonomous cruise missiles, such as the Raduga KS-1 Komet, that relied on a combination of initial guidance from the launching aircraft and terminal guidance on the missile itself. These systems allowed the aircraft to launch their attacks from outside the range of shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, in relative safety. Only the presence of defensive fighters operating at long ranges from the ships could provide cover against these attacks, by attacking the launch aircraft before they could close on the ships.
US Navy doctrine stressed long-range air cover to counter both high-speed aircraft and missiles, and development of newer short range defenses had been largely ignored. While developing expensive long-range fighters like the Douglas F6D Missileer, most ships were left equipped with older weapons, typically Bofors 40 mm guns or Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. By the early 1960s their capability against modern aircraft and missiles was limited; a lack of fast-reacting mounts, gunsight radars of limited accuracy, and long settling times for the fire control systems all meant that the guns were unlikely to be able to respond effectively against high-speed aircraft.
The introduction of sea-skimming missiles dramatically increased the threat against these ships. Unlike the earlier generation of anti-ship missiles (ASMs), sea-skimmers approached at low level, like an attack aircraft, hiding themselves until the last moment. The missiles were relatively small and much harder to hit than an attacking aircraft. While the older defenses might be considered a credible threat to a large aircraft at low altitude or a missile approaching at higher altitudes, against a sea-skimming missile they were useless. To successfully counter this threat, ships needed new weapons able to attack these targets as soon as they appeared, accurately enough to give them a high first-attempt kill probability - there would be little time for a second attempt.
Point defense missile system (PDMS)[edit]
The US Army faced a similar problem defending against attacks by high-speed jet-powered attack aircraft. In this case the local horizon was generally even more limited, blocked by trees and hills, and engagement times could be measured in seconds. They concluded that a gun-based system was simply unusable in this role; by the time the radar had locked-on and the gunsight calculated proper "lead" there would be no time to shoot at the target while it was within a gun's relatively short range. Missiles, on the other hand, could progressively tune their approach while they were flying toward the target, and their proximity fuses meant they only needed to get "close enough".
In 1959 the Army started development of the MIM-46 Mauler, which mounted a new high-speed missile on top of the ubiquitous M113 Armored Personnel Carrier chassis, along with a medium-range search radar and a separate tracking and illumination radar. In order to deal with the quick response times needed, the fire control system was semi-automatic; operators would view targets on the search radar and prioritize them, the fire control system would select ones within attack range and automatically slew the missiles toward them and launch. Since the missile would be operating close to the ground in highly cluttered environments, it used a combination of beam riding along the illumination radar and an infrared seeker in the nose, which allowed tracking as long as either the path in front or in rear of the missile remained free of obstructions.
These same basic engagement parameters - high-speed and the associated fleeting sighting times - applied to sea-skimming aircraft and missiles as well. The Navy intended to adapt the Mauler to shipboard use by removing its search radar and wiring it into the existing ship-borne radar systems instead. The 9-box launcher and illuminator radar would be retained in a relatively compact mount. Development started in 1960 under the "Point Defense Missile System" (PDMS), the naval version to be known as the "RIM-46A Sea Mauler". The Navy was so confident in the Sea Mauler that they modified the design of their latest frigates, the Knox class, to incorporate a space on the rear deck for the Sea Mauler launcher.[2]
The Navy's confidence in Mauler proved misplaced; by 1963 the program had been downgraded to a pure technology development effort due to continued problems, and was canceled outright in 1965. All three of the stakeholders, the US Army, US Navy and British Army, started looking for a replacement. While the British took a longer-term approach and developed the new Rapier missile, the US Army and Navy scrambled to find a system that could be deployed as quickly as possible. Facing the problem of guidance in a cluttered environment, the Army decided to adapt the infrared AIM-9 Sidewinder missile into the MIM-72 Chaparral. This was based on the AIM-9D, a tail-chaser, and would be useless for the Navy where its targets would be approaching head on. They required a radar-guided system, and this naturally led to the AIM-7 Sparrow. They also considered Chaparral for smaller ships due to its much smaller size, but no such fits were ever attempted.[2]
Basic point defense missile system (BPDMS)[edit]




Mark 115 manned director, initially used to guide a Sea Sparrow to its target as a part of BPDMS.


Quickly organizing the "Basic Point Defense Missile System", BPDMS, the then-current AIM-7E from the F-4 Phantom was adapted to shipboard use with surprising speed. The main developments were the new Mark 25 trainable launcher developed from the ASROC launcher, and the Mark 115 manually aimed radar illuminator that looked like two large searchlights. Operation was extremely simple; the operator would be cued to targets via voice commands from the search radar operators, and he then slewed the illuminator onto the target. The relatively wide beam of the radar only needed to be in the general direction of the target, the continuous wave signal being Doppler shifted by the moving target and showing up strongly even if it was not centered in the beam. The launcher would automatically follow the motions of the illuminator, so that when the missile was fired it would immediately see the signal being reflected off the target.
In this form the Sea Sparrow was tested on the USS Bradley[3] starting in February 1967, but this installation was removed when the Bradley was sent to Vietnam later that year. Testing continued, and between 1971 and 1975 Sea Sparrow was fitted to 31 ships, DE-1052 to 1069 and DE-1071 to 1083. The "missing ship" in the series, USS Downes (DE-1070) was instead used to test an upgraded version (see below).
The Sea Sparrow was far from an ideal weapon. Its rocket engine was designed with the assumption that it would be launched at high speed from an aircraft, and therefore is optimized for a long cruise at relatively low power. In the surface-to-air role one would rather have very high acceleration in order to allow it to intercept sea-skimming targets as soon as possible. The power profile is also suitable for cruising in thin air at high altitudes, but at low altitudes it does not produce enough power to overcome drag and dramatically decreases range; some estimates indicate that the Sea Sparrow may be effective only to 10 kilometres (6.2&#160;mi), about one quarter of the range of the air-launched Sparrow. An engine of much higher power would greatly improve performance, in spite of a shorter burning time.
Another problem is that the Sparrow is steered with its mid-mounted maneuvering wings. These were used on the Sparrow because they required less energy for basic maneuvers during cruise, but this made the missile less maneuverable overall, which was not well suited to the quick-reaction weapon. Additionally, the powered wings meant that they could not easily be adapted to fold, and therefore the launcher cells were sized to the wings instead of the missile body, taking up much more room than required. Although the Sea Sparrow was meant as a small missile system that could be fit to a wide variety of ships, the launcher was relatively large and was deployed only to larger frigates, destroyers and aircraft carriers. Finally, the manually aimed illuminator was of limited use at night or in bad weather, which was hardly encouraging for a ship-borne weapon where fog was a common occurrence.
Improved basic point defense missile system (IBPDMS)[edit]

Two MK-95 unmanned illumination radars used to guide a Sea Sparrow to its target.


In 1968, Denmark, Italy, and Norway signed an agreement with the US Navy to use the Sea Sparrow on their ships, and collaborate on improved versions. Over the next few years a number of other countries joined the NATO SEASPARROW Project Office (NSPO), and today it includes 12 member nations.[4] Under this umbrella group, the "Improved Basic Point Defense Missile System" (IBPDMS) program started even while the original version was being deployed.
IBPDMS emerged as the RIM-7H, which was essentially the RIM-7A with the mid-mounted wings modified to be able to fold.[5] This was done in a fashion similar to carrier-based aircraft; the wings were hinged at a point about 50% along the span, with the outer portions rotated back toward the body of the missile. This allowed them to be stored in tighter container tubes in the new Mark 29 launcher, and flip open automatically when they were released from the tube.
The seeker was modified to work with a variety of guidance radars, including those being used with existing European missile systems. Production of the RIM-7H began in 1973 as NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System (NSSMS) Block I. For the US Navy's use the new MK-95 illuminator system was also introduced, similar to the original Mark 115 but with automatic guidance that could be used in any weather. The MK-95 formed the basis of the highly automated Mark 91 fire control system.
Missile upgrades[edit]
In 1972 Raytheon started a Sparrow upgrade program to arm the upcoming F-15 Eagle, producing the AIM-7F. The F model replaced the older analog guidance system with a solid state version that could operate with the F-15's new pulse-doppler radar. The guidance system was much smaller, which allowed the warhead to be moved from its former rear-mounted position to one in front of the mid-mounted wings, and increased in weight to 86&#160;lbs (39&#160;kg). Moving it forward also allowed the rocket engine to be enlarged, so it was replaced by a new dual-thrust engine that quickly accelerated the missile to higher speeds, and then settled to a lower thrust for cruise. The new missiles were quickly adapted for the naval role in a fashion similar to the RIM-7H, producing the RIM-7F. The new missile used the lower model designation in spite of the newer technology than the H model.[5]
Another major upgrade to the AIM-7 followed, the AIM-7M. The M included a new monopulse radar seeker that allowed it to be shot downward from a higher-altitude aircraft at a target otherwise masked by the ground. The new model also included a completely computerized guidance system that could be updated in the field, as well as further reducing weight for yet another warhead upgrade. The computerized guidance system also included a simple autopilot that allowed the missile to continue flying toward the last known target location even with the loss of a signal, allowing the launch platform to break lock for short periods while the missile was in flight. All of these modifications also improved performance against low-altitude sea-skimming targets as well.[5] The M model entered US operational service in 1983.[6]
The original RIM-7E was capable to fly at about mach 2+, between 30 and 15,000 meters, with a range of 15-22 km (8-12 NM, depending on the target height). The RIM-7F enhanced the performances, but also the proximity fuse vs low flying targets, as the minimum altitude was reduced to 15 meters or less. The RIM-7M was capable to strike down to 8 meters (27 ft), so it was somewhat quite capable vs missiles such the Exocet.[7]
While the M model was being worked on, the US Navy also introduced an upgrade for the Mark 91 fire control system, the "Mark 23 Target Acquisition System" (TAS). TAS included a medium-range 2D radar and IFF system that fed information to a new console in the ship's combat information center. The Mark 23 automatically detected, prioritized and displayed potential targets, greatly improving reaction times of the system as a whole.[8] The Mark 23 is also used to select targets for most other weapons systems, including gunfire and other missile systems. TAS started entering the fleet in 1980.[6]




Evolved Sea Sparrow being lowered into VLS tube


The NSPO also used the M series upgrade as an opportunity to upgrade the system to allow it to be launched from a Vertical Launching System (VLS).[5] This modification uses the "Jet Vane Control" (JVC) package that is added to the bottom of the missile. On launch, a small engine in the JVC boosts the missile up above the launching ship, then uses vanes positioned in its own exhaust to quickly slew the missile into the proper alignment with the target, which is fed to the JVC during launch. As far as the Sea Sparrow is concerned, there is no difference between being launched directly from a trainable launcher or using JVC, in both cases the missile becomes active looking directly at the target.
A final upgrade to the Sparrow was the AIM-7P, which replaced the M's guidance system with an improved model that allowed mid-course upgrades to be sent from the launching platform via new rear-mounted antennas.[5] For air-to-air use this allowed the missile to be "lofted" above the target and then be directed down towards it as it approached; this gives the missile greater range as it spends more time in thinner high-altitude air. This meant that the new version could also be directly guided against surface targets that would otherwise not show up well on radar (which is a function of relative speed), allowing the ship's more powerful search radars to provide guidance until the missile approached the target and the reflected signal grew stronger. This also gave the Sea Sparrow a very useful secondary anti-shipping role that allows it to attack smaller boats.
On 1 October 1992 during NATO exercises in the Aegean Sea the USS Saratoga accidentally launched two Sea Sparrow missiles. These hit the Turkish destroyer TCG Muavenet in the bridge and CIC, killing five of the ship's officers and injuring twenty-two men. The Muavenet was written off as a result, and the US presented them with the Knox class frigate USS Capodanno as reparations.
Evolved Sea Sparrow missile (ESSM)[edit]
Main article: RIM-162 ESSM

Although the Navy and Air Force initially planned additional upgrades for the Sparrow, notably the AIM-7R with a combination radar/infrared seeker, these were canceled in favor of the much more advanced AIM-120 AMRAAM in December 1996. With the link between the airborne and shipborne versions of the Sparrow severed, Raytheon proposed a much more extensive set of upgrades to the Sea Sparrow, the RIM-7R Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM). The changes were so extensive that the project was renamed, becoming the RIM-162 ESSM.[9]
The ESSM takes the existing guidance section from the RIM-7P and fits it to an entirely new rear-section. The new missile is 10&#160;inches in diameter instead of the previous 8&#160;inches, which allows for a much more powerful motor. It also eliminates the mid-mounted wings entirely, replacing them with long fins similar to those on the Standard missile (and practically every other Navy missile since the 1950s) and moves guidance control to the rear fins. The tail-fin based steering of the ESSM uses up more energy but offers considerably higher maneuverability while the engine is still firing.
The Mark 25 quad-missile pack was developed during the 1990s to fit four ESSMs into a single Mk 41 VLS cell.[10] For VLS use, ESSMs are fitted with the same JVC system as the earlier versions.

Light to carry and easy to operate, the FIM-92 Stinger is a passive surface-to-air missile, that can be shoulder-fired by a single operator (although standard military procedure calls for two operators, spotter and gunner). The FIM-92B missile can also be fired from the M-1097 Avenger and the M6 Linebacker. The missile is also capable of being deployed from a Humvee Stinger rack, and can be used by airborne troops. A helicopter launched version exists called Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS).
The missile is 5.0&#160;ft (1.52&#160;m) long and 2.8&#160;in (70&#160;mm) in diameter with 10&#160;cm fins. The missile itself weighs 22&#160;lb (10.1&#160;kg), while the missile with launcher weighs approximately 34&#160;lb (15.2&#160;kg). The Stinger is launched by a small ejection motor that pushes it a safe distance from the operator before engaging the main two-stage solid-fuel sustainer, which accelerates it to a maximum speed of Mach&#160;2.54 (750&#160;m/s). The warhead is a 3&#160;kg penetrating hit-to-kill warhead type with an impact fuze and a self-destruct timer.
To fire the missile, a BCU (Battery Coolant Unit) is inserted into the handguard. This shoots a stream of argon gas into the system, as well as a chemical energy charge that enables the acquisition indicators and missile to get power. The batteries are somewhat sensitive to abuse, with a limited amount of gas. Over time, and without proper maintenance, they can become unserviceable. The IFF system receives power from a rechargeable battery. Guidance to the target is initially through proportional navigation, then switches to another mode that directs the missile towards the target airframe instead of its exhaust plume.
There are three main variants in use: the Stinger basic, STINGER-Passive Optical Seeker Technique (POST), and STINGER-Reprogrammable Microprocessor (RMP). These correspond to the FIM-92A, FIM-92B, and FIM-92C and later variants respectively.
The POST has a dual-detector seeker: IR and UV. This allows it to distinguish targets from countermeasures much better than the Redeye and FIM-92A, which have IR-only. While modern flares can have an IR signature that is closely matched to the launching aircraft's engine exhaust, there is a readily distinguishable difference in UV signature between flares and jet engines.[2] The Stinger-RMP is so-called because of its ability to load a new set of software via ROM chip inserted in the grip at the depot. If this download to the missile fails during power-up, basic functionality runs off the on-board ROM. The four-processor RMP has 4 KB of RAM for each processor. Since the downloaded code runs from RAM, there is little space to spare, particularly for processors dedicated to seeker input processing and target analysis.

Initial work on the missile was begun by General Dynamics in 1967 as the Redeye II. It was accepted for further development by the U.S. Army in 1971 and designated FIM-92; the Stinger appellation was chosen in 1972. Because of technical difficulties that dogged testing, the first shoulder launch was not until mid-1975. Production of the FIM-92A began in 1978 to replace the FIM-43 Redeye. An improved Stinger with a new seeker, the FIM-92B, was produced from 1983 alongside the FIM-92A. Production of both the A and B types ended in 1987 with around 16,000 missiles produced.
The replacement FIM-92C had been developed from 1984 and production began in 1987. The first examples were delivered to front-line units in 1989. C-type missiles were fitted with a reprogrammable electronics system to allow for upgrades. The missiles which received a counter-measures upgrade were designated D and later upgrades to the D were designated G.
The FIM-92E or Block I was developed from 1992 and delivered from 1995 (certain sources state that the FIM-92D is also part of the Block I development). The main changes were again in the sensor and the software, improving the missile's performance against smaller and low-signature targets. A software upgrade in 2001 was designated F. Block II development began in 1996 using a new focal plane array sensor to improve the missile's effectiveness in "high clutter" environments and increase the engagement range to about 25,000 feet (7,600 m). Production was scheduled for 2004, but Jane's reports that this may be on hold.
Since 1984 the Stinger has been issued to many U.S. Navy warships for point defense, particularly in Middle Eastern waters, with a three-man team that can perform other duties when not conducting Stinger training or maintenance. Until it was decommissioned in September 1993, the U.S. Navy had at least one Stinger Gunnery Detachment attached to Beachmaster Unit Two in Little Creek Virginia. The sailors of this detachment would deploy to carrier battlegroups in teams of two to four sailors per ship as requested by Battle Group Commanders.
Variants[edit]

FIM-92A, Stinger Basic: The basic model.[3]
FIM-92B, Stinger POST: In this version, the infrared seeker head was replaced by a combined IR/UV seeker that utilized rosette scanning. This resulted in achieving significantly higher resistance to enemy countermeasures (Flares) and natural disturbances. Production ran from 1981 to 1987, a total of 600 missiles were produced.[3]
FIM-92C, Stinger RMP: The resistance to interference was increased again by adding more powerful digital computer components. Moreover, the software of the missile could now be reconfigured in a short time in order to respond quickly and efficiently to new types of countermeasures. Until 1991, some 20,000 units were produced for the U.S. Army alone.[3]
FIM-92D: Various modifications were continued with this version in order to increase the resistance to interference.[3]
FIM-92E: Stinger - RMP Block I: By adding a new rollover sensor and revised control software, the flight behavior was significantly improved. Additionally, the performance against small targets such as drones, cruise missiles and light reconnaissance helicopters was improved. The first deliveries began in 1995. Almost the entire stock of U.S. Stinger missiles was replaced by this version.[3]
FIM-92F: A further improvement of the E-version and the current production version.[3]
FIM-92G: An unspecified upgrade for the D variant.[3]
FIM-92H: Indicates a D-variant that has been upgraded to the E standard.[3]
FIM-92?, Stinger - RMP Block II: This variant was a planned developed based on the E version. The improvements included an imaging infrared seeker head from the AIM-9X. With this modification, the detection distance and the resistance to jamming was to be greatly increased . Changes to the airframe would furthermore enable a significant increase in range. Although the missile reached the testing phase, the program was dropped in 2002 for budgetary reasons.[3]
FIM-92J, Block 1 missile upgrade to replace aging components to extend service life an additional 10 years. The warhead is also equipped with a proximity fuse to increase effectiveness against unmanned aerial vehicles.[4]
ADSM, Air Defence Missile Suppression: A variant with an additional passive radar seeker, this variant can also be used against radar wave transmitters.[3]

Falklands War[edit]
The Stinger's combat debut occurred during the Falklands War fought between the United Kingdom and Argentina. At the onset of the conflict soldiers of the British Army's Special Air Service had been clandestinely equipped with six missiles, although they had received little instruction in their use. The sole SAS trooper who had received training on the system, and was due to train other troops, was killed in a helicopter crash on 19 May.[8] Nonetheless, on 21 May 1982 an SAS soldier engaged and shot down an Argentine Pucará ground attack aircraft with a Stinger.[9] On 30 May, at about 11.00 a.m., an Aerospatiale SA-330 Puma helicopter was brought down by another missile, also fired by the SAS, in the vicinity of Mount Kent. Six National Gendarmerie Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded.[10] The main MANPADS used by both sides during the Falklands War was the Blowpipe missile.
Soviet War in Afghanistan[edit]
See also: List of Soviet aircraft losses in Afghanistan
The story of the Stingers in Afghanistan was popularly told in the media by western sources primarily, notably in the references written in Charlie Wilson's War by George Crile, and Ghost Wars by Steve Coll.
In late 1985, several groups, such as Free the Eagle, began arguing the CIA was not doing enough to support the Mujahideen in the Soviet–Afghan War. Michael Pillsbury, Vincent Cannistraro, and others put enormous bureaucratic pressure on the CIA to begin providing the Stinger to the rebels. The idea was controversial because up to that point, the CIA had been operating with the pretense that the United States was not involved in the war directly, for various reasons. All weapons supplied at that point were non-U.S. made weapons, like Type 56 rifles purchased from China,[11] and AK-47 and AKM AK derivatives purchased from Egypt.
The final say-so came down to President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan, through whom the CIA had to pass all of its funding and weapons to the Mujahideen. President Zia constantly had to gauge how much he could "make the pot boil" in Afghanistan without provoking a Soviet invasion of his own country. According to George Crile III, U.S. congressman Charlie Wilson's relationship with Zia was instrumental in the final go-ahead for the Stinger introduction.[11]
Wilson and his associates at first viewed the Stinger as "just adding another component to the lethal mix we were building".[11] Their increasingly successful Afghanistan strategy, formed largely by Michael G. Vickers, was based on a broad mix of weapons, tactics, and logistics, not a 'silver bullet solution' of a single weapon. Furthermore the previous attempts to provide MANPADs to the Mujahideen, namely the SA7 and Blowpipe, hadn't worked very well.[11]
Engineer Ghaffar of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami, brought down the first Hind gunship with a Stinger on September 25, 1986 near Jalalabad.[11][12][13] The Central Intelligence Agency eventually supplied nearly 500 Stingers (some sources claim 1,500–2,000) to the Mujahideen in Afghanistan as part of Operation Cyclone.[14] with the supply of 250 launchers.[15]
The impact of the Stinger on the outcome of the war is contested, particularly in the translation between the impact on the tactical/battlefield to the strategic level withdrawal, and the influence the first had on the second.[16] While Fort Leavenworth's Dr. Robert F. Baumann describes its impact on "Soviet tactical operations" as "unmistakable" in Compound Warfare: That Fatal Knot,[17][18] an opinion similarly supported by Yossef Bodansky's Sams in Afghanistan: assessing the impact published in a 1987 issue of Jane's Defence Weekly.[19][20] Soviet, and later, Russian, accounts give little significance to the Stinger for strategically ending the war.[14][21][22]
According to a 1993 US Air Defense Artillery publication, the Mujahideen gunners used the supplied Stingers to score approximately 269 total aircraft kills in about 340 engagements, a 79-percent kill ratio.[23] Which if accurate, would make it responsible for over half of the 451 Soviet aircraft losses in Afghanistan if they only engaged Soviet aircraft, however as the Afghan occupation was fought both by Soviet and Afghan government aircraft, a large number of kills inflicted by the Stinger was on aircraft operated by those of the Afghan government, who were increasingly sent on the more dangerous missions by the Soviets.[20] An analysis of the Stinger's role in the withdrawal of the Soviet Union, the statistics supporting the Stinger's unusually high kill ratio and the chronology leading up to the decision to deploy the weapon, was made in 1999.[20]
According to Crile, who includes information from Alexander Prokhanov, the Stinger was a "turning point".[11] Milt Bearden saw it as a "force multiplier" and morale booster.[11] Charlie Wilson, the congressman behind the United States' Operation Cyclone, described the first Stinger Mi-24 shootdowns in 1986 as one of the three crucial moments of his experience in the war, saying "we never really won a set piece battle before September 26, and then we never lost one afterwards".[24][25] He was given the first spent Stinger tube as a gift and kept it on his office wall.[11][25] That launch tube is now on exhibit at the US Army Air Defense Artillery Museum, Fort Sill, OK.
The last Stingers were supplied in 1988 after increasing reports of fighters selling them to Iran and thawing relations with Moscow.[13][26] After the 1989 Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the U.S. attempted to buy back the Stinger missiles, with a $55 million program launched in 1990 to buy back around 300 missiles (US$183,300 each).[27] The U.S. government collected most of the Stingers it had delivered, but by 1996 around 600 were unaccounted for and some found their way into Croatia, Iran, Sri Lanka, Qatar and North Korea.[28][29] According to the CIA, already in August 1988 the U.S. had demanded from Qatar the return of Stinger missiles.[30] Wilson later told CBS he "lived in terror" that a civilian airliner would be shot down by a Stinger, but he did not have misgivings about having provided Stingers to defeat the Soviets.[25]
Angolan Civil War[edit]
The Reagan administration provided 310 Stingers to Jonas Savimbi's UNITA movement in Angola between 1986 and 1989.[31] As in Afghanistan, efforts to recover missiles after the end of hostilities proved incomplete. The battery of a Stinger lasts for four or five years, so any weapons supplied in the 1980s would now be inoperative.[32]
Libyan invasion of Chad[edit]
The Chadian government received Stinger missiles from the United States, when Libya invaded the northern part of the African country. On 8 October 1987, a Libyan Su-22MK was shot down by a FIM-92A fired by Chadian forces. The pilot, Capt. Diya al-Din, ejected and was captured. He was later granted political asylum by the French government. During the recovery operation, a Libyan MiG-23MS was shot down by a FIM-92A.[33]
Tajik civil war[edit]
Tajik Islamist opposition forces operating from Afghanistan during the 1992–97 Tajik civil war encountered a heavy air campaign launched by Russia and Uzbekistan to prop up the government in Dushanbe that included border and cross-border raids. During one of these operations, a Sukhoi Su-24M was shot down on 3 May 1993 with a Stinger fired by fundamentalists. Both Russian pilots were rescued.[34][35]
Chechen War[edit]
Russian officials claimed several times the presence of US-made Stinger missiles in the hands of the Chechen militia and insurgents. They attributed few of their aerial losses to the American MANPADS. The presence of such missiles was confirmed by photo evidence even if it is not clear their actual number nor their origin.[36]
It is believed one Sukhoi Su-24 was shot down by a Stinger missile during the Second Chechen War.[37]
Sri Lankan Civil War[edit]
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam also managed to acquire one or several Stingers, possibly from former Mujahideen stocks, and used at least one to down a Sri Lanka Air Force Mi-24 on November 10, 1997.[29][38]
United States[edit]
The current U.S. inventory contains 13,400 missiles. The total cost of the program is $7,281,000,000.[39] It is rumored that the United States Secret Service has Stinger missiles to defend the President, a notion that has never been dispelled; however, U.S. Secret Service plans favor moving the President to a safer place in the event of an attack rather than shooting down the plane, lest the missile (or the wreckage of the target aircraft) hit innocents.[40]
During the 1980s, the Stinger was used to support different US-aligned guerrilla forces, notably the Afghan Mujahidins, the Chad government against the Libyan invasion and the Angolan UNITA. The Nicaraguan contras were not provided with Stingers due to the lack of fixed wing aircraft of the Sandinista government, as such the previous generation FIM-43 Redeye was considered adequate.[21]
Syrian civil war[edit]
In the Syrian civil war, Turkey reportedly helped to transport to the anti-government rebels a limited amount of FIM-92 Stingers.[41][42]

A wall-mount cabinet containing optical fiber interconnects. The yellow cables are single mode fibers; the orange and aqua cables are multi-mode fibers: 50/125 µm OM2 and 50/125 µm OM3 fibers respectively.


An optical fiber (or optical fibre) is a flexible, transparent fiber made by drawing glass (silica) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair.[1] Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two ends of the fiber and find wide usage in fiber-optic communications, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths (data rates) than wire cables. Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with lesser amounts of loss; in addition, fibers are also immune to electromagnetic interference, a problem which metal wires suffer from excessively.[2][3] Fibers are also used for illumination, and are wrapped in bundles so that they may be used to carry images, thus allowing viewing in confined spaces, as in the case of a fiberscope.[4] Specially designed fibers are also used for a variety of other applications, some of them being fiber optic sensors and fiber lasers.[5]
Optical fibers typically include a transparent core surrounded by a transparent cladding material with a lower index of refraction. Light is kept in the core by the phenomenon of total internal reflection which causes the fiber to act as a waveguide.[6] Fibers that support many propagation paths or transverse modes are called multi-mode fibers (MMF), while those that support a single mode are called single-mode fibers (SMF). Multi-mode fibers generally have a wider core diameter and are used for short-distance communication links and for applications where high power must be transmitted.[citation needed] Single-mode fibers are used for most communication links longer than 1,000 meters (3,300&#160;ft).[citation needed]
An important aspect of a fiber optic communication is that of extension of the fiber optic cables such that the losses brought about by joining two different cables is kept to a minimum.[7] Joining lengths of optical fiber often proves to be more complex than joining electrical wire or cable and involves careful cleaving of the fibers, perfect alignment of the fiber cores, and the splicing of these aligned fiber cores. For applications that demand a permanent connection a mechanical splice which holds the ends of the fibers together mechanically could be used or a fusion splice that uses heat to fuse the ends of the fibers together could be used. Temporary or semi-permanent connections are made by means of specialized optical fiber connectors.[8]
The field of applied science and engineering concerned with the design and application of optical fibers is known as fiber optics.

History[edit]




Daniel Colladon first described this “light fountain” or “light pipe” in an 1842 article titled On the reflections of a ray of light inside a parabolic liquid stream. This particular illustration comes from a later article by Colladon, in 1884.


Guiding of light by refraction, the principle that makes fiber optics possible, was first demonstrated by Daniel Colladon and Jacques Babinet in Paris in the early 1840s. John Tyndall included a demonstration of it in his public lectures in London, 12 years later.[9] Tyndall also wrote about the property of total internal reflection in an introductory book about the nature of light in 1870:

When the light passes from air into water, the refracted ray is bent towards the perpendicular... When the ray passes from water to air it is bent from the perpendicular... If the angle which the ray in water encloses with the perpendicular to the surface be greater than 48 degrees, the ray will not quit the water at all: it will be totally reflected at the surface.... The angle which marks the limit where total reflection begins is called the limiting angle of the medium. For water this angle is 48°27′, for flint glass it is 38°41′, while for diamond it is 23°42′.[10][11]

Unpigmented human hairs have also been shown to act as an optical fiber.[12]
Practical applications, such as close internal illumination during dentistry, appeared early in the twentieth century. Image transmission through tubes was demonstrated independently by the radio experimenter Clarence Hansell and the television pioneer John Logie Baird in the 1920s. The principle was first used for internal medical examinations by Heinrich Lamm in the following decade. Modern optical fibers, where the glass fiber is coated with a transparent cladding to offer a more suitable refractive index, appeared later in the decade.[9] Development then focused on fiber bundles for image transmission. Harold Hopkins and Narinder Singh Kapany at Imperial College in London achieved low-loss light transmission through a 75&#160;cm long bundle which combined several thousand fibers. Their article titled "A flexible fibrescope, using static scanning" was published in the journal Nature in 1954.[13][14] The first fiber optic semi-flexible gastroscope was patented by Basil Hirschowitz, C. Wilbur Peters, and Lawrence E. Curtiss, researchers at the University of Michigan, in 1956. In the process of developing the gastroscope, Curtiss produced the first glass-clad fibers; previous optical fibers had relied on air or impractical oils and waxes as the low-index cladding material.
A variety of other image transmission applications soon followed.
In 1880 Alexander Graham Bell and Sumner Tainter invented the Photophone at the Volta Laboratory in Washington, D.C., to transmit voice signals over an optical beam.[15] It was an advanced form of telecommunications, but subject to atmospheric interferences and impractical until the secure transport of light that would be offered by fiber-optical systems. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, light was guided through bent glass rods to illuminate body cavities.[16] Jun-ichi Nishizawa, a Japanese scientist at Tohoku University, also proposed the use of optical fibers for communications in 1963, as stated in his book published in 2004 in India.[17] Nishizawa invented other technologies that contributed to the development of optical fiber communications, such as the graded-index optical fiber as a channel for transmitting light from semiconductor lasers.[18][19] The first working fiber-optical data transmission system was demonstrated by German physicist Manfred Börner at Telefunken Research Labs in Ulm in 1965, which was followed by the first patent application for this technology in 1966.[20][21] Charles K. Kao and George A. Hockham of the British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) were the first to promote the idea that the attenuation in optical fibers could be reduced below 20 decibels per kilometer (dB/km), making fibers a practical communication medium.[22] They proposed that the attenuation in fibers available at the time was caused by impurities that could be removed, rather than by fundamental physical effects such as scattering. They correctly and systematically theorized the light-loss properties for optical fiber, and pointed out the right material to use for such fibers&#160;— silica glass with high purity. This discovery earned Kao the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.[23]
NASA used fiber optics in the television cameras that were sent to the moon. At the time, the use in the cameras was classified confidential, and only those with sufficient security clearance or those accompanied by someone with the right security clearance were permitted to handle the cameras.[24]
The crucial attenuation limit of 20&#160;dB/km was first achieved in 1970, by researchers Robert D. Maurer, Donald Keck, Peter C. Schultz, and Frank Zimar working for American glass maker Corning Glass Works, now Corning Incorporated. They demonstrated a fiber with 17&#160;dB/km attenuation by doping silica glass with titanium. A few years later they produced a fiber with only 4&#160;dB/km attenuation using germanium dioxide as the core dopant. Such low attenuation ushered in the era of optical fiber telecommunication. In 1981, General Electric produced fused quartz ingots that could be drawn into strands 25 miles (40&#160;km) long.[25]
Attenuation in modern optical cables is far less than in electrical copper cables, leading to long-haul fiber connections with repeater distances of 70–150 kilometers (43–93&#160;mi). The erbium-doped fiber amplifier, which reduced the cost of long-distance fiber systems by reducing or eliminating optical-electrical-optical repeaters, was co-developed by teams led by David N. Payne of the University of Southampton and Emmanuel Desurvire at Bell Labs in 1986. Robust modern optical fiber uses glass for both core and sheath, and is therefore less prone to aging. It was invented by Gerhard Bernsee of Schott Glass in Germany in 1973.[26]
The emerging field of photonic crystals led to the development in 1991 of photonic-crystal fiber,[27] which guides light by diffraction from a periodic structure, rather than by total internal reflection. The first photonic crystal fibers became commercially available in 2000.[28] Photonic crystal fibers can carry higher power than conventional fibers and their wavelength-dependent properties can be manipulated to improve performance.
Uses[edit]
Communication[edit]
Main article: Fiber-optic communication
Optical fiber can be used as a medium for telecommunication and computer networking because it is flexible and can be bundled as cables. It is especially advantageous for long-distance communications, because light propagates through the fiber with little attenuation compared to electrical cables. This allows long distances to be spanned with few repeaters.
The per-channel light signals propagating in the fiber have been modulated at rates as high as 111 gigabits per second (Gbit/s) by NTT,[29][30] although 10 or 40&#160;Gbit/s is typical in deployed systems.[31][32] In June 2013, researchers demonstrated transmission of 400 Gbit/s over a single channel using 4-mode orbital angular momentum multiplexing.[33]
Each fiber can carry many independent channels, each using a different wavelength of light (wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM)). The net data rate (data rate without overhead bytes) per fiber is the per-channel data rate reduced by the FEC overhead, multiplied by the number of channels (usually up to eighty in commercial dense WDM systems as of 2008[update]). As of 2011[update] the record for bandwidth on a single core was 101 Tbit/s (370 channels at 273 Gbit/s each).[34] The record for a multi-core fiber as of January 2013 was 1.05 petabits per second. [35] In 2009, Bell Labs broke the 100 (petabit per second)×kilometer barrier (15.5 Tbit/s over a single 7,000&#160;km fiber).[36]
For short distance application, such as a network in an office building, fiber-optic cabling can save space in cable ducts. This is because a single fiber can carry much more data than electrical cables such as standard category 5 Ethernet cabling, which typically runs at 100 Mbit/s or 1 Gbit/s speeds. Fiber is also immune to electrical interference; there is no cross-talk between signals in different cables, and no pickup of environmental noise. Non-armored fiber cables do not conduct electricity, which makes fiber a good solution for protecting communications equipment in high voltage environments, such as power generation facilities, or metal communication structures prone to lightning strikes. They can also be used in environments where explosive fumes are present, without danger of ignition. Wiretapping (in this case, fiber tapping) is more difficult compared to electrical connections, and there are concentric dual-core fibers that are said to be tap-proof.[37]
Fibers are often also used for short-distance connections between devices. For example, most high-definition televisions offer a digital audio optical connection. This allows the streaming of audio over light, using the TOSLINK protocol.
Advantages over copper wiring[edit]
The advantages of optical fiber communication with respect to copper wire systems are:

Broad bandwidth
A single optical fiber can carry over 3,000,000 full-duplex voice calls or 90,000 TV channels.


Immunity to electromagnetic interference
Light transmission through optical fibers is unaffected by other electromagnetic radiation nearby. The optical fiber is electrically non-conductive, so it does not act as an antenna to pick up electromagnetic signals. Information traveling inside the optical fiber is immune to electromagnetic interference, even electromagnetic pulses generated by nuclear devices.


Low attenuation loss over long distances
Attenuation loss can be as low as 0.2&#160;dB/km in optical fiber cables, allowing transmission over long distances without the need for repeaters.


Electrical insulator
Optical fibers do not conduct electricity, preventing problems with ground loops and conduction of lightning. Optical fibers can be strung on poles alongside high voltage power cables.


Material cost and theft prevention
Conventional cable systems use large amounts of copper. In some places, this copper is a target for theft due to its value on the scrap market.


Security of information passed down the cable
Copper can be tapped with very little chance of detection.

Sensors[edit]
Main article: Fiber optic sensor
Fibers have many uses in remote sensing. In some applications, the sensor is itself an optical fiber. In other cases, fiber is used to connect a non-fiberoptic sensor to a measurement system. Depending on the application, fiber may be used because of its small size, or the fact that no electrical power is needed at the remote location, or because many sensors can be multiplexed along the length of a fiber by using different wavelengths of light for each sensor, or by sensing the time delay as light passes along the fiber through each sensor. Time delay can be determined using a device such as an optical time-domain reflectometer.
Optical fibers can be used as sensors to measure strain, temperature, pressure and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the property to measure modulates the intensity, phase, polarization, wavelength, or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of such fiber optic sensors is that they can, if required, provide distributed sensing over distances of up to one meter. In contrast, highly localized measurements can be provided by integrating miniaturized sensing elements with the tip of the fiber.[38] These can be implemented by various micro- and nanofabrication technologies, such that they do not exceed the microscopic boundary of the fiber tip, allowing such applications as insertion into blood vessels via hypodermic needle.
Extrinsic fiber optic sensors use an optical fiber cable, normally a multi-mode one, to transmit modulated light from either a non-fiber optical sensor—or an electronic sensor connected to an optical transmitter. A major benefit of extrinsic sensors is their ability to reach otherwise inaccessible places. An example is the measurement of temperature inside aircraft jet engines by using a fiber to transmit radiation into a radiation pyrometer outside the engine. Extrinsic sensors can be used in the same way to measure the internal temperature of electrical transformers, where the extreme electromagnetic fields present make other measurement techniques impossible. Extrinsic sensors measure vibration, rotation, displacement, velocity, acceleration, torque, and twisting. A solid state version of the gyroscope, using the interference of light, has been developed. The fiber optic gyroscope (FOG) has no moving parts, and exploits the Sagnac effect to detect mechanical rotation.
Common uses for fiber optic sensors includes advanced intrusion detection security systems. The light is transmitted along a fiber optic sensor cable placed on a fence, pipeline, or communication cabling, and the returned signal is monitored and analyzed for disturbances. This return signal is digitally processed to detect disturbances and trip an alarm if an intrusion has occurred.
Power transmission[edit]
Optical fiber can be used to transmit power using a photovoltaic cell to convert the light into electricity.[39] While this method of power transmission is not as efficient as conventional ones, it is especially useful in situations where it is desirable not to have a metallic conductor as in the case of use near MRI machines, which produce strong magnetic fields.[40] Other examples are for powering electronics in high-powered antenna elements and measurement devices used in high-voltage transmission equipment.
Other uses[edit]

Light reflected from optical fiber illuminates exhibited model


Optical fibers have a wide number of applications. They are used as light guides in medical and other applications where bright light needs to be shone on a target without a clear line-of-sight path. In some buildings, optical fibers route sunlight from the roof to other parts of the building (see nonimaging optics). Optical fiber lamps are used for illumination in decorative applications, including signs, art, toys and artificial Christmas trees. Swarovski boutiques use optical fibers to illuminate their crystal showcases from many different angles while only employing one light source. Optical fiber is an intrinsic part of the light-transmitting concrete building product, LiTraCon.




Use of optical fiber in a decorative lamp or nightlight.


Optical fiber is also used in imaging optics. A coherent bundle of fibers is used, sometimes along with lenses, for a long, thin imaging device called an endoscope, which is used to view objects through a small hole. Medical endoscopes are used for minimally invasive exploratory or surgical procedures. Industrial endoscopes (see fiberscope or borescope) are used for inspecting anything hard to reach, such as jet engine interiors. Many microscopes use fiber-optic light sources to provide intense illumination of samples being studied.
In spectroscopy, optical fiber bundles transmit light from a spectrometer to a substance that cannot be placed inside the spectrometer itself, in order to analyze its composition. A spectrometer analyzes substances by bouncing light off and through them. By using fibers, a spectrometer can be used to study objects remotely.[41][42][43]
An optical fiber doped with certain rare earth elements such as erbium can be used as the gain medium of a laser or optical amplifier. Rare-earth-doped optical fibers can be used to provide signal amplification by splicing a short section of doped fiber into a regular (undoped) optical fiber line. The doped fiber is optically pumped with a second laser wavelength that is coupled into the line in addition to the signal wave. Both wavelengths of light are transmitted through the doped fiber, which transfers energy from the second pump wavelength to the signal wave. The process that causes the amplification is stimulated emission.
Optical fiber is also widely exploited as a nonlinear medium. The glass medium supports a host of nonlinear optical interactions, and the long interaction lengths possible in fiber facilitate a variety of phenomena, which are harnessed for applications and fundamental investigation.[44] Conversely, fiber nonlinearity can have deleterious effects on optical signals, and measures are often required to minimize such unwanted effects.
Optical fibers doped with a wavelength shifter collect scintillation light in physics experiments.
Fiber optic sights for handguns, rifles, and shotguns use pieces of optical fiber to improve visibility of markings on the sight.
Principle of operation[edit]


Play media


An overview of the operating principles of the optical fiber


An optical fiber is a cylindrical dielectric waveguide (nonconducting waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, by the process of total internal reflection. The fiber consists of a core surrounded by a cladding layer, both of which are made of dielectric materials. To confine the optical signal in the core, the refractive index of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in step-index fiber, or gradual, in graded-index fiber.
Index of refraction[edit]
Main article: Refractive index
The index of refraction (or refractive index) is a way of measuring the speed of light in a material. Light travels fastest in a vacuum, such as in outer space. The speed of light in a vacuum is about 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second. The refractive index of a medium is calculated by dividing the speed of light in a vacuum by the speed of light in that medium. The refractive index of a vacuum is therefore 1, by definition. A typical singlemode fiber used for telecommunications has a cladding made of pure silica, with an index of 1.444 at 1,500&#160;nm, and a core of doped silica with an index around 1.4475.[45] The larger the index of refraction, the slower light travels in that medium. From this information, a simple rule of thumb is that a signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200,000 kilometers per second. To put it another way, the signal will take 5 milliseconds to travel 1,000 kilometers in fiber. Thus a phone call carried by fiber between Sydney and New York, a 16,000-kilometer distance, means that there is a minimum delay of 80 milliseconds (about  of a second) between when one caller speaks and the other hears. (The fiber in this case will probably travel a longer route, and there will be additional delays due to communication equipment switching and the process of encoding and decoding the voice onto the fiber).
Total internal reflection[edit]
Main article: Total internal reflection
When light traveling in an optically dense medium hits a boundary at a steep angle (larger than the critical angle for the boundary), the light is completely reflected. This is called total internal reflection. This effect is used in optical fibers to confine light in the core. Light travels through the fiber core, bouncing back and forth off the boundary between the core and cladding. Because the light must strike the boundary with an angle greater than the critical angle, only light that enters the fiber within a certain range of angles can travel down the fiber without leaking out. This range of angles is called the acceptance cone of the fiber. The size of this acceptance cone is a function of the refractive index difference between the fiber's core and cladding.
In simpler terms, there is a maximum angle from the fiber axis at which light may enter the fiber so that it will propagate, or travel, in the core of the fiber. The sine of this maximum angle is the numerical aperture (NA) of the fiber. Fiber with a larger NA requires less precision to splice and work with than fiber with a smaller NA. Single-mode fiber has a small NA.
Multi-mode fiber[edit]




The propagation of light through a multi-mode optical fiber.

Main article: Multi-mode optical fiber
Fiber with large core diameter (greater than 10&#160;micrometers) may be analyzed by geometrical optics. Such fiber is called multi-mode fiber, from the electromagnetic analysis (see below). In a step-index multi-mode fiber, rays of light are guided along the fiber core by total internal reflection. Rays that meet the core-cladding boundary at a high angle (measured relative to a line normal to the boundary), greater than the critical angle for this boundary, are completely reflected. The critical angle (minimum angle for total internal reflection) is determined by the difference in index of refraction between the core and cladding materials. Rays that meet the boundary at a low angle are refracted from the core into the cladding, and do not convey light and hence information along the fiber. The critical angle determines the acceptance angle of the fiber, often reported as a numerical aperture. A high numerical aperture allows light to propagate down the fiber in rays both close to the axis and at various angles, allowing efficient coupling of light into the fiber. However, this high numerical aperture increases the amount of dispersion as rays at different angles have different path lengths and therefore take different times to traverse the fiber.




Optical fiber types.


In graded-index fiber, the index of refraction in the core decreases continuously between the axis and the cladding. This causes light rays to bend smoothly as they approach the cladding, rather than reflecting abruptly from the core-cladding boundary. The resulting curved paths reduce multi-path dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower-index periphery of the core, rather than the high-index center. The index profile is chosen to minimize the difference in axial propagation speeds of the various rays in the fiber. This ideal index profile is very close to a parabolic relationship between the index and the distance from the axis.

Main article: Single-mode optical fiber
Fiber with a core diameter less than about ten times the wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an optical waveguide, the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core is large enough to support more than a few modes.
The waveguide analysis shows that the light energy in the fiber is not completely confined in the core. Instead, especially in single-mode fibers, a significant fraction of the energy in the bound mode travels in the cladding as an evanescent wave.
The most common type of single-mode fiber has a core diameter of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the near infrared. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The normalized frequency V for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the Bessel function J0 (approximately 2.405).
Special-purpose fiber[edit]
Some special-purpose optical fiber is constructed with a non-cylindrical core and/or cladding layer, usually with an elliptical or rectangular cross-section. These include polarization-maintaining fiber and fiber designed to suppress whispering gallery mode propagation. Polarization-maintaining fiber is a unique type of fiber that is commonly used in fiber optic sensors due to its ability to maintain the polarization of the light inserted into it.
Photonic-crystal fiber is made with a regular pattern of index variation (often in the form of cylindrical holes that run along the length of the fiber). Such fiber uses diffraction effects instead of or in addition to total internal reflection, to confine light to the fiber's core. The properties of the fiber can be tailored to a wide variety of applications.
Mechanisms of attenuation[edit]




Light attenuation by ZBLAN and silica fibers


Main article: Transparent materials
Attenuation in fiber optics, also known as transmission loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a fiber of silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation is an important factor limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal. Empirical research has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17&#160;dB/km at 1550&#160;nm.[46] For example, an 8&#160;km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550&#160;nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one could see all the way to the bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.[47]
Light scattering[edit]




Specular reflection






Diffuse reflection


The propagation of light through the core of an optical fiber is based on total internal reflection of the lightwave. Rough and irregular surfaces, even at the molecular level, can cause light rays to be reflected in random directions. This is called diffuse reflection or scattering, and it is typically characterized by wide variety of reflection angles.
Light scattering depends on the wavelength of the light being scattered. Thus, limits to spatial scales of visibility arise, depending on the frequency of the incident light-wave and the physical dimension (or spatial scale) of the scattering center, which is typically in the form of some specific micro-structural feature. Since visible light has a wavelength of the order of one micrometer (one millionth of a meter) scattering centers will have dimensions on a similar spatial scale.
Thus, attenuation results from the incoherent scattering of light at internal surfaces and interfaces. In (poly)crystalline materials such as metals and ceramics, in addition to pores, most of the internal surfaces or interfaces are in the form of grain boundaries that separate tiny regions of crystalline order. It has recently been shown that when the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent. This phenomenon has given rise to the production of transparent ceramic materials.
Similarly, the scattering of light in optical quality glass fiber is caused by molecular level irregularities (compositional fluctuations) in the glass structure. Indeed, one emerging school of thought is that a glass is simply the limiting case of a polycrystalline solid. Within this framework, "domains" exhibiting various degrees of short-range order become the building blocks of both metals and alloys, as well as glasses and ceramics. Distributed both between and within these domains are micro-structural defects that provide the most ideal locations for light scattering. This same phenomenon is seen as one of the limiting factors in the transparency of IR missile domes.[48]
At high optical powers, scattering can also be caused by nonlinear optical processes in the fiber.[49][50]
UV-Vis-IR absorption[edit]
In addition to light scattering, attenuation or signal loss can also occur due to selective absorption of specific wavelengths, in a manner similar to that responsible for the appearance of color. Primary material considerations include both electrons and molecules as follows:
1) At the electronic level, it depends on whether the electron orbitals are spaced (or "quantized") such that they can absorb a quantum of light (or photon) of a specific wavelength or frequency in the ultraviolet (UV) or visible ranges. This is what gives rise to color.
2) At the atomic or molecular level, it depends on the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how close-packed its atoms or molecules are, and whether or not the atoms or molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.
The design of any optically transparent device requires the selection of materials based upon knowledge of its properties and limitations. The Lattice absorption characteristics observed at the lower frequency regions (mid IR to far-infrared wavelength range) define the long-wavelength transparency limit of the material. They are the result of the interactive coupling between the motions of thermally induced vibrations of the constituent atoms and molecules of the solid lattice and the incident light wave radiation. Hence, all materials are bounded by limiting regions of absorption caused by atomic and molecular vibrations (bond-stretching)in the far-infrared (&gt;10&#160;µm).
Thus, multi-phonon absorption occurs when two or more phonons simultaneously interact to produce electric dipole moments with which the incident radiation may couple. These dipoles can absorb energy from the incident radiation, reaching a maximum coupling with the radiation when the frequency is equal to the fundamental vibrational mode of the molecular dipole (e.g. Si-O bond) in the far-infrared, or one of its harmonics.
The selective absorption of infrared (IR) light by a particular material occurs because the selected frequency of the light wave matches the frequency (or an integer multiple of the frequency) at which the particles of that material vibrate. Since different atoms and molecules have different natural frequencies of vibration, they will selectively absorb different frequencies (or portions of the spectrum) of infrared (IR) light.
Reflection and transmission of light waves occur because the frequencies of the light waves do not match the natural resonant frequencies of vibration of the objects. When IR light of these frequencies strikes an object, the energy is either reflected or transmitted.
Manufacturing[edit]
Materials[edit]
Glass optical fibers are almost always made from silica, but some other materials, such as fluorozirconate, fluoroaluminate, and chalcogenide glasses as well as crystalline materials like sapphire, are used for longer-wavelength infrared or other specialized applications. Silica and fluoride glasses usually have refractive indices of about 1.5, but some materials such as the chalcogenides can have indices as high as 3. Typically the index difference between core and cladding is less than one percent.
Plastic optical fibers (POF) are commonly step-index multi-mode fibers with a core diameter of 0.5 millimeters or larger. POF typically have higher attenuation coefficients than glass fibers, 1&#160;dB/m or higher, and this high attenuation limits the range of POF-based systems.
Silica[edit]
Silica exhibits fairly good optical transmission over a wide range of wavelengths. In the near-infrared (near IR) portion of the spectrum, particularly around 1.5 μm, silica can have extremely low absorption and scattering losses of the order of 0.2&#160;dB/km. Such remarkably low losses are possible only because ultra-pure silicon is available, it being essential for manufacturing integrated circuits and discrete transistors. A high transparency in the 1.4-μm region is achieved by maintaining a low concentration of hydroxyl groups (OH). Alternatively, a high OH concentration is better for transmission in the ultraviolet (UV) region.[51]
Silica can be drawn into fibers at reasonably high temperatures, and has a fairly broad glass transformation range. One other advantage is that fusion splicing and cleaving of silica fibers is relatively effective. Silica fiber also has high mechanical strength against both pulling and even bending, provided that the fiber is not too thick and that the surfaces have been well prepared during processing. Even simple cleaving (breaking) of the ends of the fiber can provide nicely flat surfaces with acceptable optical quality. Silica is also relatively chemically inert. In particular, it is not hygroscopic (does not absorb water).
Silica glass can be doped with various materials. One purpose of doping is to raise the refractive index (e.g. with germanium dioxide (GeO2) or aluminium oxide (Al2O3)) or to lower it (e.g. with fluorine or boron trioxide (B2O3)). Doping is also possible with laser-active ions (for example, rare earth-doped fibers) in order to obtain active fibers to be used, for example, in fiber amplifiers or laser applications. Both the fiber core and cladding are typically doped, so that the entire assembly (core and cladding) is effectively the same compound (e.g. an aluminosilicate, germanosilicate, phosphosilicate or borosilicate glass).
Particularly for active fibers, pure silica is usually not a very suitable host glass, because it exhibits a low solubility for rare earth ions. This can lead to quenching effects due to clustering of dopant ions. Aluminosilicates are much more effective in this respect.
Silica fiber also exhibits a high threshold for optical damage. This property ensures a low tendency for laser-induced breakdown. This is important for fiber amplifiers when utilized for the amplification of short pulses.
Because of these properties silica fibers are the material of choice in many optical applications, such as communications (except for very short distances with plastic optical fiber), fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, and fiber-optic sensors. Large efforts put forth in the development of various types of silica fibers have further increased the performance of such fibers over other materials.[52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59]
Fluoride glass[edit]
Fluoride glass is a class of non-oxide optical quality glasses composed of fluorides of various metals. Because of their low viscosity, it is very difficult to completely avoid crystallization while processing it through the glass transition (or drawing the fiber from the melt). Thus, although heavy metal fluoride glasses (HMFG) exhibit very low optical attenuation, they are not only difficult to manufacture, but are quite fragile, and have poor resistance to moisture and other environmental attacks. Their best attribute is that they lack the absorption band associated with the hydroxyl (OH) group (3,200–3,600&#160;cm−1; i.e., 2,777–3,125&#160;nm or 2.78–3.13 μm), which is present in nearly all oxide-based glasses.
An example of a heavy metal fluoride glass is the ZBLAN glass group, composed of zirconium, barium, lanthanum, aluminium, and sodium fluorides. Their main technological application is as optical waveguides in both planar and fiber form. They are advantageous especially in the mid-infrared (2,000–5,000&#160;nm) range.
HMFGs were initially slated for optical fiber applications, because the intrinsic losses of a mid-IR fiber could in principle be lower than those of silica fibers, which are transparent only up to about 2 μm. However, such low losses were never realized in practice, and the fragility and high cost of fluoride fibers made them less than ideal as primary candidates. Later, the utility of fluoride fibers for various other applications was discovered. These include mid-IR spectroscopy, fiber optic sensors, thermometry, and imaging. Also, fluoride fibers can be used for guided lightwave transmission in media such as YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) lasers at 2.9 μm, as required for medical applications (e.g. ophthalmology and dentistry).[60][61]
Phosphate glass[edit]




The P4O10 cagelike structure—the basic building block for phosphate glass.


Phosphate glass constitutes a class of optical glasses composed of metaphosphates of various metals. Instead of the SiO4 tetrahedra observed in silicate glasses, the building block for this glass former is phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), which crystallizes in at least four different forms. The most familiar polymorph (see figure) comprises molecules of P4O10.
Phosphate glasses can be advantageous over silica glasses for optical fibers with a high concentration of doping rare earth ions. A mix of fluoride glass and phosphate glass is fluorophosphate glass.[62][63]
Chalcogenide glass[edit]
The chalcogens—the elements in group 16 of the periodic table—particularly sulfur (S), selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te)—react with more electropositive elements, such as silver, to form chalcogenides. These are extremely versatile compounds, in that they can be crystalline or amorphous, metallic or semiconducting, and conductors of ions or electrons. Glass containing chalcogenides can be used to make fibers for far infrared transmission.[citation needed]
Process[edit]
Preform[edit]




Illustration of the modified chemical vapor deposition (inside) process


Standard optical fibers are made by first constructing a large-diameter "preform" with a carefully controlled refractive index profile, and then "pulling" the preform to form the long, thin optical fiber. The preform is commonly made by three chemical vapor deposition methods: inside vapor deposition, outside vapor deposition, and vapor axial deposition.[64]
With inside vapor deposition, the preform starts as a hollow glass tube approximately 40 centimeters (16&#160;in) long, which is placed horizontally and rotated slowly on a lathe. Gases such as silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) or germanium tetrachloride (GeCl4) are injected with oxygen in the end of the tube. The gases are then heated by means of an external hydrogen burner, bringing the temperature of the gas up to 1,900&#160;K (1,600&#160;°C, 3,000&#160;°F), where the tetrachlorides react with oxygen to produce silica or germania (germanium dioxide) particles. When the reaction conditions are chosen to allow this reaction to occur in the gas phase throughout the tube volume, in contrast to earlier techniques where the reaction occurred only on the glass surface, this technique is called modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD).
The oxide particles then agglomerate to form large particle chains, which subsequently deposit on the walls of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as thermophoresis). The torch is then traversed up and down the length of the tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has reached the end of the tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. For each layer the composition can be modified by varying the gas composition, resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.
In outside vapor deposition or vapor axial deposition, the glass is formed by flame hydrolysis, a reaction in which silicon tetrachloride and germanium tetrachloride are oxidized by reaction with water (H2O) in an oxyhydrogen flame. In outside vapor deposition the glass is deposited onto a solid rod, which is removed before further processing. In vapor axial deposition, a short seed rod is used, and a porous preform, whose length is not limited by the size of the source rod, is built up on its end. The porous preform is consolidated into a transparent, solid preform by heating to about 1,800&#160;K (1,500&#160;°C, 2,800&#160;°F).




Cross-section of a fiber drawn from a D-shaped preform


Typical communications fiber uses a circular preform. For some applications such as double-clad fibers another form is preferred.[65] In fiber lasers based on double-clad fiber, an asymmetric shape improves the filling factor for laser pumping.
Because of the surface tension, the shape is smoothed during the drawing process, and the shape of the resulting fiber does not reproduce the sharp edges of the preform. Nevertheless, careful polishing of the preform is important, since any defects of the preform surface affect the optical and mechanical properties of the resulting fiber. In particular, the preform for the test-fiber shown in the figure was not polished well, and cracks are seen with the confocal optical microscope.
Drawing[edit]
The preform, however constructed, is placed in a device known as a drawing tower, where the preform tip is heated and the optical fiber is pulled out as a string. By measuring the resultant fiber width, the tension on the fiber can be controlled to maintain the fiber thickness.
Coatings[edit]
The light is guided down the core of the fiber by an optical cladding with a lower refractive index that traps light in the core through total internal reflection.
The cladding is coated by a buffer that protects it from moisture and physical damage.[53] The buffer coating is what gets stripped off the fiber for termination or splicing. These coatings are UV-cured urethane acrylate composite or polyimide materials applied to the outside of the fiber during the drawing process. The coatings protect the very delicate strands of glass fiber—about the size of a human hair—and allow it to survive the rigors of manufacturing, proof testing, cabling and installation.
Today’s glass optical fiber draw processes employ a dual-layer coating approach. An inner primary coating is designed to act as a shock absorber to minimize attenuation caused by microbending. An outer secondary coating protects the primary coating against mechanical damage and acts as a barrier to lateral forces. Sometimes a metallic armor layer is added to provide extra protection.
These fiber optic coating layers are applied during the fiber draw, at speeds approaching 100 kilometers per hour (60&#160;mph). Fiber optic coatings are applied using one of two methods: wet-on-dry and wet-on-wet. In wet-on-dry, the fiber passes through a primary coating application, which is then UV cured—then through the secondary coating application, which is subsequently cured. In wet-on-wet, the fiber passes through both the primary and secondary coating applications, then goes to UV curing.
Fiber optic coatings are applied in concentric layers to prevent damage to the fiber during the drawing application and to maximize fiber strength and microbend resistance. Unevenly coated fiber will experience non-uniform forces when the coating expands or contracts, and is susceptible to greater signal attenuation. Under proper drawing and coating processes, the coatings are concentric around the fiber, continuous over the length of the application and have constant thickness.
Fiber optic coatings protect the glass fibers from scratches that could lead to strength degradation. The combination of moisture and scratches accelerates the aging and deterioration of fiber strength. When fiber is subjected to low stresses over a long period, fiber fatigue can occur. Over time or in extreme conditions, these factors combine to cause microscopic flaws in the glass fiber to propagate, which can ultimately result in fiber failure.
Three key characteristics of fiber optic waveguides can be affected by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending. External fiber optic coatings protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiber’s performance and long-term durability. On the inside, coatings ensure the reliability of the signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.
Practical issues[edit]
Cable construction[edit]




An optical fiber cable


Main article: Optical fiber cable
In practical fibers, the cladding is usually coated with a tough resin buffer layer, which may be further surrounded by a jacket layer, usually glass. These layers add strength to the fiber but do not contribute to its optical wave guide properties. Rigid fiber assemblies sometimes put light-absorbing ("dark") glass between the fibers, to prevent light that leaks out of one fiber from entering another. This reduces cross-talk between the fibers, or reduces flare in fiber bundle imaging applications.[66][67]
Modern cables come in a wide variety of sheathings and armor, designed for applications such as direct burial in trenches, high voltage isolation, dual use as power lines,[68][not in citation given] installation in conduit, lashing to aerial telephone poles, submarine installation, and insertion in paved streets. The cost of small fiber-count pole-mounted cables has greatly decreased due to the high demand for fiber to the home (FTTH) installations in Japan and South Korea.
Fiber cable can be very flexible, but traditional fiber's loss increases greatly if the fiber is bent with a radius smaller than around 30&#160;mm. This creates a problem when the cable is bent around corners or wound around a spool, making FTTX installations more complicated. "Bendable fibers", targeted towards easier installation in home environments, have been standardized as ITU-T G.657. This type of fiber can be bent with a radius as low as 7.5&#160;mm without adverse impact. Even more bendable fibers have been developed.[69] Bendable fiber may also be resistant to fiber hacking, in which the signal in a fiber is surreptitiously monitored by bending the fiber and detecting the leakage.[70]
Another important feature of cable is cable's ability to withstand horizontally applied force. It is technically called max tensile strength defining how much force can be applied to the cable during the installation period.
Some fiber optic cable versions are reinforced with aramid yarns or glass yarns as intermediary strength member. In commercial terms, usage of the glass yarns are more cost effective while no loss in mechanical durability of the cable. Glass yarns also protect the cable core against rodents and termites.
Termination and splicing[edit]




ST connectors on multi-mode fiber.


Optical fibers are connected to terminal equipment by optical fiber connectors. These connectors are usually of a standard type such as FC, SC, ST, LC, MTRJ, or SMA, which is designated for higher power transmission. All of these standardised connectors are a "physical contact" (PC) type where the mating surfaces touch each other to achieve the lowest possible attenuation, and all but the ST have a keyed ferrule that allows and angled (APC) mating surface to reduce reflections that can cause problems with laser transmitters.
Optical fibers may be connected to each other by connectors or by splicing, that is, joining two fibers together to form a continuous optical waveguide. The generally accepted splicing method is arc fusion splicing, which melts the fiber ends together with an electric arc. For quicker fastening jobs, a “mechanical splice” is used.
Fusion splicing is done with a specialized instrument that typically operates as follows: The two cable ends are fastened inside a splice enclosure that will protect the splices, and the fiber ends are stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified viewing screen to check the cleaves before and after the splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1&#160;dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.
Mechanical fiber splices are designed to be quicker and easier to install, but there is still the need for stripping, careful cleaning and precision cleaving. The fiber ends are aligned and held together by a precision-made sleeve, often using a clear index-matching gel that enhances the transmission of light across the joint. Such joints typically have higher optical loss and are less robust than fusion splices, especially if the gel is used. All splicing techniques involve installing an enclosure that protects the splice.
Fibers are terminated in connectors that hold the fiber end precisely and securely. A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be push and click, turn and latch (bayonet mount), or screw-in (threaded). A typical connector is installed by preparing the fiber end and inserting it into the rear of the connector body. Quick-set adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a strain relief is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, depending on the type of fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.
In the 1990s, terminating fiber optic cables was labor-intensive. The number of parts per connector, polishing of the fibers, and the need to oven-bake the epoxy in each connector made terminating fiber optic cables difficult. Today, many connectors types are on the market that offer easier, less labor-intensive ways of terminating cables. Some of the most popular connectors are pre-polished at the factory, and include a gel inside the connector. Those two steps help save money on labor, especially on large projects. A cleave is made at a required length, to get as close to the polished piece already inside the connector. The gel surrounds the point where the two pieces meet inside the connector for very little light loss.[citation needed]
Free-space coupling[edit]
It is often necessary to align an optical fiber with another optical fiber, or with an optoelectronic device such as a light-emitting diode, a laser diode, or a modulator. This can involve either carefully aligning the fiber and placing it in contact with the device, or can use a lens to allow coupling over an air gap. In some cases the end of the fiber is polished into a curved form that makes it act as a lens. Some companies can even shape the fiber into lenses by cutting them with lasers.[71]
In a laboratory environment, a bare fiber end is coupled using a fiber launch system, which uses a microscope objective lens to focus the light down to a fine point. A precision translation stage (micro-positioning table) is used to move the lens, fiber, or device to allow the coupling efficiency to be optimized. Fibers with a connector on the end make this process much simpler: the connector is simply plugged into a pre-aligned fiberoptic collimator, which contains a lens that is either accurately positioned with respect to the fiber, or is adjustable. To achieve the best injection efficiency into single-mode fiber, the direction, position, size and divergence of the beam must all be optimized. With good beams, 70 to 90% coupling efficiency can be achieved.
With properly polished single-mode fibers, the emitted beam has an almost perfect Gaussian shape—even in the far field—if a good lens is used. The lens needs to be large enough to support the full numerical aperture of the fiber, and must not introduce aberrations in the beam. Aspheric lenses are typically used.
Fiber fuse[edit]
At high optical intensities, above 2 megawatts per square centimeter, when a fiber is subjected to a shock or is otherwise suddenly damaged, a fiber fuse can occur. The reflection from the damage vaporizes the fiber immediately before the break, and this new defect remains reflective so that the damage propagates back toward the transmitter at 1–3 meters per second (4–11&#160;km/h, 2–8&#160;mph).[72][73] The open fiber control system, which ensures laser eye safety in the event of a broken fiber, can also effectively halt propagation of the fiber fuse.[74] In situations, such as undersea cables, where high power levels might be used without the need for open fiber control, a "fiber fuse" protection device at the transmitter can break the circuit to keep damage to a minimum.
Chromatic dispersion[edit]
Main article: Dispersion (optics)
The refractive index of fibers varies slightly with the frequency of light, and light sources are not perfectly monochromatic. Modulation of the light source to transmit a signal also slightly widens the frequency band of the transmitted light. This has the effect that, over long distances and at high modulation speeds, the different frequencies of light can take different times to arrive at the receiver, ultimately making the signal impossible to discern, and requiring extra repeaters.[75] This problem can be overcome in a number of ways, including the use of a relatively short length of fiber that has the opposite refractive index gradient.

The Martin Marietta SM-68A/HGM-25A Titan I was the United States' first multistage rocket Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), in use from 1959 until 1965. Incorporating the latest design technology when designed and manufactured, the Titan I provided an additional nuclear deterrent to complement the U.S. Air Force's SM-65 Atlas missile. It was the first in a series of Titan rockets, but was unique among them in that it used liquid oxygen and RP-1 as propellants, while the later Titan ICBM versions all used storeable fuels instead. Though the SM-68A was operational for only three years, it was an important step in building the Air Force's strategic nuclear forces.

Origins[edit]
The program began in January 1955 and took shape in parallel with the Atlas (SM-65/HGM-16) intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The Air Force's goal in launching the Titan program was twofold: one, to serve as a backup should Atlas fail; and two, to develop a large, two-stage missile with a longer range and bigger payload that also could serve as a booster for space flights[citation needed].
The Titan I was initially designated SM-68; it was later redesignated HGM-25A.
Characteristics[edit]
Produced by the Glenn L. Martin Company (which became "The Martin Company" in 1957), Titan I was a two-stage, liquid-fueled missile. The first stage delivered 300,000 pounds (1,330&#160;kN) of thrust, the second stage 80,000 pounds (356&#160;kN). The fact that Titan I, like Atlas, burned RP-1 and LOX meant that the oxidizer had to be loaded onto the missile just before launch from the underground storage tank, and the missile raised above ground on the enormous elevator system, exposing the missile for some time before launch. The complexity of the system combined with its relatively slow reaction time – fifteen minutes to load, raise and launch the first missile, made it a less effective weapon system.
Titan I utilized partial radio command guidance. The inertial guidance system originally intended for the missile was instead eventually deployed in the Atlas E missile. (The Atlas series was intended to be the first generation of American ICBMs and Titan II (as opposed to Titan I) was to be the second generation deployed). The Titan 1's onboard computers mainly flew the rocket, with frequent corrections from a ground-based computer. As a result, the Titan 1's computer system consisted of three gyroscopes in each stage, an autopilot amplifier package, and, in the case of the upper stage, servos to move the vernier engines.[1][2]
Titan I also was the first true multi-stage (two or more stages) design. Whereas in Atlas, all rocket engines were ignited at launch (including two small thrust vernier engines) due to the unreliable nature of the engines[citation needed], Titan I’s second-stage engines were reliable enough to be ignited at altitude, after separation from the first-stage booster; and its fuel tanks, engines, launch interface equipment, and launch pad thrust ring. Titan I’s ability to jettison this mass prior to the ignition of the second stage, meant that Titan I had a much greater total range (and a greater range per pound of second-stage fuel) than Atlas, even if the total fuel load of Atlas had been greater.[citation needed]
The Titan I had an effective range of 5,500 nautical miles (10,200&#160;km). When the first stage had finished consuming its propellant, it dropped away, thereby decreasing the mass of the vehicle. That made for a more efficient missile, which resulted in increased range and enabled a larger payload.
The warhead of the Titan I was an AVCO Mk 4 re-entry vehicle containing a W38 thermonuclear bomb with a yield of 3.75 megatons which was fuzed for either air burst or contact burst. The Mk 4 RV also deployed penetration aids in the form of mylar balloons which replicated the radar signature of the Mk 4 RV.
Research and development[edit]
The Titan I was tested in a comprehensive test program prior to deployment. From the first successful launch on 5 February 1959 with Titan-1 A3 through to 29 January 1962 Titan-1 M7. There were seven variants of the Titan-1 Research and Development missile: six A-types (four launched) seven B-types (two launched), six C-types (five launched), ten G-types (seven launched), 22 J-types (22 launched), four V-types (four launched), seven M-types (seven launched). 62 produced (49 launched and two exploded). They were tested and launched at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station from Launch Complexes LC15, LC16, LC19 and LC20.
The first four tests of the Titan I (the Lot A missiles) were carried out on February 6, February 25, April 3, and May 4, 1959, all with dummy second stages. The success of these initial flights left launch crews unprepared for the coming events. On August 14, the first attempt to fly a Lot B (all-up version with a live second stage) ended in disaster when the missile was released from LC-19 before it had built up sufficient thrust. The pad umbilical sent a shutdown signal to the engines and the Titan fell back onto the pad and exploded.
In December, the second attempt to launch a complete Titan ended in practically identical fashion when vibration tripped the range safety destruct package on the first stage of Missile C-3 one second after liftoff, leading to another pad explosion. On February 2, 1960, Missile B-7 marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage. On February 5, Missile C-4 failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed from aerodynamic pressure, causing the payload shroud to separate. The missile pitched down and was blown up by Range Safety. After first stage destruction, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30-40 miles downrange. After a successful test on the 24th, Missile C-1's second stage failed to ignite on March 8. A run of successful launches followed during the spring, but the first attempt at flying a Lot J missile on July 1 went awry when a broken hydraulic line caused total loss of control within moments of liftoff. The Titan began flying on a near horizontal plane before Range Safety issued the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The next launch at the end of the month suffered premature first stage shutdown and landed far short of its planned impact point. Missile J-6 on October 24 set a record by flying 6100 miles.
In December, Missile V-2 was undergoing a flight readiness test in a silo at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The plan was to load the missile with propellant, raise it up to firing position, and then lower it back into the silo. Unfortunately, the silo elevator collapsed, causing the Titan to fall back down and explode. The blast was so violent that it ejected a service tower from inside the silo and launched it some distance into the air before coming back down.
Although most of the Titan I's teething problems were worked out by 1961, the missile was already eclipsed not only by the Atlas, but by its own designated successor, the Titan II, a bigger, more powerful ICBM with storable hypergolic propellants. The launch pads at Cape Canaveral were quickly converted for the new vehicle and as Vandenberg lacked actual pads (only silos), the Titan I quickly found itself homeless. After a brief period as an operational ICBM, it was retired from service in 1965 when Defense Secretary Robert McNamara made the decision to phase out all first generation cryogenically fueled missiles in favor of newer hypergolic and solid-fueled models. While decommissioned Atlas (and later Titan II) missiles were recycled and utilized for space launches, the Titan I inventory was simply scrapped.[3]
Operational deployment[edit]
Titan-1 Strategic Missile (SM) production began during the final stages of the Research and Development program[when?]. In total, 101 Titan-1 SMs were produced to be tested from underground silos at Vandenberg Air Force Base and then stationed in silos in six squadrons of nine missiles each across America. Fifty-four missiles in silos in total, with one missile as a spare on standby at each squadron, bringing to 60 in service at any one time.
The Titan I was first American ICBM based in underground silos, and it gave USAF managers, contractors and missile crews valuable experience building and working in vast bunkers containing everything the missiles and crews needed for operation and survival. The complexes were composed of a control center, powerhouse, and two antenna silos for the ATHENA guidance radars.
These early silos, however, had certain drawbacks. First, the missiles took about 15 minutes to fuel, and then had to be lifted to the surface on huge elevators for launching, which slowed their reaction time. Rapid launching was crucial to avoid possible destruction by incoming missiles, even though Titan shelters were designed to withstand nuclear blasts. Second, the missiles' placement close together in groups of three—necessary because they shared a single ground-based radio guidance system—made them vulnerable to nuclear attack. All-inertial guidance, which does not depend on ground computers, was not yet perfected.
The distance between the antenna silos and the most distant missile silo was between 1,000 and 1,300 feet (400&#160;m). These were by far the most complex, extensive and expensive missile launch facilities ever deployed by the USAF[citation needed]. Launching a missile required fueling it in its silo, and then raising the launcher and missile out of the silo on a massive elevator. Before each launch the guidance radar had to be calibrated by acquiring a special target at a precisely known range and bearing. When the missile was launched, the guidance radar tracked the missile and supplied precise velocity range and azimuth data to the missile's guidance system. Because of this the complex could only launch and track one missile at a time.
Although Titan I's two stages gave it true intercontinental range and foreshadowed future multistage rockets, its propellants were dangerous and hard to handle. Super-chilled liquid oxygen oxidizer had to be pumped aboard the missile just before launch, and complex equipment was required to store and move this liquid. Kerosene fuel also was pumped aboard just before launch.
In its brief career, six squadrons were equipped with the Titan I. Each squadron was deployed in a 3x3 configuration, which meant a total of nine missiles were divided into three launch sites in Colorado, Idaho, California, Washington state and South Dakota. Each missile site had three Titan I ICBM missiles ready to launch at any given time. See squadron article for location of launch sites.

Retirement[edit]
When the storable-fueled Titan II and the solid-fueled Minuteman I were deployed in 1963, the Titan I and Atlas missiles became obsolete. They were retired from service as ICBMs in early 1965. The count as of 5 March 1965 (the final launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB): 17 were launched from VAFB (September 1961 – March 1965); one was destroyed in Beale AFB Site 851-C1 silo explosion 24 May 1962; 54 were based in Silos with SAC by 20 January 1965; 29 were in storage SBAMA (three at VAFB, one at each Base, including an extra at Lowry = 9 and 20 in storage at SBAMA elsewhere), a total of 101 production SM vehicles. The 83 surplus missiles remained in inventory at Mira Loma AFS. SM-65 Atlas missiles had already been converted to satellite launchers in the early 1960s, and the Titan I's had about the same payload capacity as an Atlas. It did not make economic sense to refurbish the 83 remaining missiles as launch vehicles. About 33 were distributed to museums, parks and schools as static displays (see list below). The remaining 50 missiles were scrapped at Mira Loma AFS near San Bernardino, CA, the last was broken up in 1972, in accordance with the SALT-I Treaty of 1 February 1972.
The official count is 101 Titan I Strategic Missiles produced: 17 Test launched, 1 lost, 50 destroyed Mira Loma, 33 at museum/display (some missing).
On 6 September 1985 Strategic Defense Initiative (AKA "Star Wars" program), a scrapped Titan I Second Stage was used in a Missile Defense test. The MIRACL Near Infrared Laser, at White Sands Missile Range, NM was fired at a stationary Titan I second stage that was fixed to ground. The second stage burst and was destroyed by the laser blast. The second stage did not contain any fuel or oxidizer. It was pressurized with nitrogen gas to 60-psi. A follow-up test 6 days later was conducted on a scrapped Thor IRBM, its remnants reside at the SLC-10 Museum at Vandenberg AFB.

Static displays and articles[edit]
There should be 33 Static Titan 1 Strategic Missiles and two (plus five possible) Research and Development Missiles to account for (of these 22 have been positively identified by Serial Number, eight known but need to be identified) and three are unaccounted for, missing.[citation needed]

			Variadic macro
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				A variadic macro is a feature of some computer programming languages, especially the C preprocessor, whereby a macro may be declared to accept a varying number of arguments.
Variable-argument macros were introduced in 1999 in the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99) revision of the C language standard, and in 2011 in ISO/IEC 14882:2011 (C++11) revision of the C++ language standard.[1]

Declaration syntax[edit]
The declaration syntax is similar to that of variadic functions: an ellipsis "..." is used to indicate that one or more arguments must be passed. Common compilers also permit passing zero arguments to such a macro, however.[2][3] During macro expansion each occurrence of the special identifier __VA_ARGS__ in the macro replacement list is replaced by the passed arguments.
No means is provided to access individual arguments in the variable argument list, nor to find out how many were passed. However, macros can be written to count the number of arguments that have been passed.[4]
Support[edit]
Several compilers support variable-argument macros when compiling C and C++ code: the GNU Compiler Collection 3.0,[2] Clang (all versions),[5] Visual Studio 2005,[3] C++Builder 2006, and Oracle Solaris Studio (formerly Sun Studio) Forte Developer 6 update 2 (C++ version 5.3).[6] GCC also supports such macros when compiling Objective-C.
Example[edit]
If a printf-like function dbgprintf() were desired, which would take the file and line number from which it was called as arguments, the following macro might be used:


// Our implemented function
void realdbgprintf (const char *SourceFilename, int SourceLineno, const char *CFormatString, ...);

// Due to a design bug of the variadic macro in C++, the following is more readable, but should be avoided.
// Reason is, that dbgprintf("Hallo") will be expanded to realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, "Hallo", )
// The comma before the closing brace will result in a syntax error ...
//#define dbgprintf(cformat, ...) realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, cformat, __VA_ARGS__)

// GNU C++ supports the non portable extension:
//#define dbgprintf(cformat, ...) realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, cformat, ##__VA_ARGS__)

// By using the cformat string as part of the variadic arguments we can avoid this.
// This is a tricky, but portable solution.
#define dbgprintf(...) realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, __VA_ARGS__)

dbgprintf() could then be called as:


dbgprintf ("Hello, world");

which expands to:


realdbgprintf (__FILE__, __LINE__, "Hello, world");

or:


dbgprintf("%d + %d = %d", 2, 2, 5);

which expands to:


realdbgprintf(__FILE__, __LINE__, "%d + %d = %d", 2, 2, 5);

Without variadic macros, writing wrappers to printf is not directly possible. The standard workaround is to use the stdargs functionality of C/C++, and have the function call vprintf instead.
Trailing comma[edit]
There is portability issue with generating a trailing comma with empty args for variadic macros in C99. Some compilers (e.g.: Visual Studio[3]) will quietly get rid of that trailing comma for you. Other compilers (e.g.: GCC[2]) support putting ## in front of __VA_ARGS__


#define MYLOG(FormatLiteral, ...)  fprintf (stderr, "%s(%d): " FormatLiteral "\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, __VA_ARGS__)

The following application works


MYLOG("Too many balloons %u", 42);

which expands to


fprintf (stderr, "%s(%u): " "Too many balloons %u" "\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, 42);

which is equivalent to


fprintf (stderr, "%s(%u): Too many balloons %u\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, 42);

But look at this application:


MYLOG("Attention!");

which expands to


fprintf (stderr, "%s(%u): " "Attention!" "\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, );

which generates a syntax error with GCC.
GCC supports the following (non-portable) extension:


#define MYLOG(FormatLiteral, ...)  fprintf (stderr, "%s(%u): " FormatLiteral "\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, ##__VA_ARGS__)

which removes the trailing comma when __VA_ARGS__ is empty.
Alternatives[edit]
Before the existence of variable-arguments in C99, it was quite common to use doubly nested parenthesis to exploit the variable number of arguments that could be supplied to the printf() function&#160;:


#define dbgprintf(x) realdbgprintf x

dbgprintf() could then be called as:


dbgprintf (("Hello, world %d", 27));

which expands to:


realdbgprintf ("Hello, world %d", 27);

Gameplay[edit]
Unlimited Adventures is essentially a role-playing game construction kit, and draws on the prior Gold Box engine games for its content.[2] A player could create hundreds of different monsters, triggers as part of adventure design on the computer.[2]
The chief feature of interest in this computer role-playing game is that it contains an editor that allows the user of the game to create new adventures that anyone else who owns the game can play. The game uses a variant of TSR, Inc.'s Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules in the gameplay. The engine within which adventures are played is based on the Gold Box engine that made its debut in the game Pool of Radiance, although some improvements have been made (for instance, the color depth has been increased from 4 bits to 8 bits). Despite possessing features that, today, are considered limited (such as a 320×200 pixel resolution), the versatility and ease of use offered by this engine have created a community of users who remain active to the present day.
The original game allowed the user to create dungeon modules, some editing and renaming of monsters and characters, and to import pictures and monster sprites. However, some art, such as walls, combat backdrops, and title screens, could not be changed in the unmodified game.
Those deficiencies have been overcome by a now fairly extensive library of hacks, which allow the designer to change things not changeable in the game out of the box. Other hacks allow the designer to alter the game play itself: to create new weapons and other items, to alter spells, and to change other aspects of gameplay. The availability of these hacks has led to the creation of a number of comprehensive "worldhacks", designed to allow the creation of science fiction, superhero, Western and Roman Empire adventures, among others. A program called "UASHELL" applies and manages these hacks and enables the player to apply them. The fanmade game design program Dungeon Craft (originally called UA Forever) is a standalone program that partially emulates FRUA's engine, but with a greater ease of user modification.
More than seven hundred adventure designs have been created for this game. They vary widely in quality, and the best of them are comparable in depth to the original commercial releases.
Reception[edit]
Computer Gaming World in 1993 called Unlimited Adventures "the best adventure-construction kit available" despite the "sorely lacking" Gold Box engine.[3] According to GameSpy in 2004, although "the game's graphics were poor [...] and using the tools could be a little complicated, Unlimited Adventures was an excellent tool for budding RPG designers".[4]

			Builder pattern
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				The builder pattern is an object creation software design pattern. Unlike the abstract factory pattern and the factory method pattern whose intention is to enable polymorphism, the intention of the builder pattern is to find a solution to the telescoping constructor anti-pattern[citation needed]. The telescoping constructor anti-pattern occurs when the increase of object constructor parameter combination leads to an exponential list of constructors. Instead of using numerous constructors, the builder pattern uses another object, a builder, that receives each initialization parameter step by step and then returns the resulting constructed object at once.
The builder pattern has another benefit. It can be used for objects that contain flat data (html code, SQL query, X.509 certificate...), that is to say, data that can't be easily edited. This type of data cannot be edited step by step and must be edited at once. The best way to construct such an object is to use a builder class.[citation needed]
Builder often builds a Composite. Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed. Sometimes creational patterns are complementary: Builder can use one of the other patterns to implement which components are built. Builders are good candidates for a fluent interface.

Definition[edit]
The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation. By doing so the same construction process can create different representations. [1]
Structure[edit]




Builder
Abstract interface for creating objects (product).


Concrete Builder
Provides implementation for Builder. It is an object able to construct other objects. Constructs and assembles parts to build the objects.

Pseudocode[edit]
We have a Car class. The problem is that a car has many options. The combination of each option would lead to a huge list of constructors for this class. So we will create a builder class, CarBuilder. We will send to the CarBuilder each car option step by step and then construct the final car with the right options:

class Car is
  Can have GPS, trip computer and various numbers of seats.
  Can be a city car, a sports car, or a cabriolet.

class CarBuilder is
  method getResult() is
      output:  a Car with the right options
    Construct and return the car.

  method setSeats(number) is
      input:  the number of seats the car may have.
    Tell the builder the number of seats.

  method setCityCar() is
    Make the builder remember that the car is a city car.

  method setCabriolet() is
    Make the builder remember that the car is a cabriolet.

  method setSportsCar() is
    Make the builder remember that the car is a sports car.

  method setTripComputer() is
    Make the builder remember that the car has a trip computer.

  method unsetTripComputer() is
    Make the builder remember that the car does not have a trip computer.

  method setGPS() is
    Make the builder remember that the car has a global positioning system.

  method unsetGPS() is
    Make the builder remember that the car does not have a global positioning system.

Construct a CarBuilder called carBuilder
carBuilder.setSeats(2)
carBuilder.setSportsCar()
carBuilder.setTripComputer()
carBuilder.unsetGPS()
car := carBuilder.getResult()

Of course one could dispense with Builder and just do this:

car = new Car();
car.seats = 2;
car.type = CarType.SportsCar;
car.setTripComputer();
car.unsetGPS();
car.isValid();

So this indicates that the Builder pattern is more than just a means to limit constructor proliferation. It removes what could be a complex building process from being the responsibility of the actual user of the object that is built. It also allows for inserting new implementations of how an object is built without disturbing the client code.
C# Example[edit]


//Represents a product created by the builder
public class Car
{
    public Car()
    {
    }

    public int Wheels { get; set; }

    public string Colour { get; set; }
}

//The builder abstraction
public interface ICarBuilder
{
    // Adding NotNull attribute to prevent null input argument
    void SetColour([NotNull]string colour);

    // Adding NotNull attribute to prevent null input argument
    void SetWheels([NotNull]int count);

    Car GetResult();
}

//Concrete builder implementation
public class CarBuilder : ICarBuilder
{
    private Car _car;

    public CarBuilder()
    {
        this._car = new Car();
    }

    public void SetColour(string colour)
    {
        this._car.Colour = colour;
    }

    public void SetWheels(int count)
    {
        this._car.Wheels = count;
    }

    public Car GetResult()
    {
        return this._car;
    }
}

//The director
public class CarBuildDirector
{
    public Car Construct()
    {
        CarBuilder builder = new CarBuilder();

        builder.SetColour("Red");
        builder.SetWheels(4);

        return builder.GetResult();
    }
}

The Director assembles a car instance in the example above, delegating the construction to a separate builder object.
C++ Example[edit]


////// Product declarations and inline impl. (possibly Product.h) //////
class Product{
	public:
		// use this class to construct Product
		class Builder;

	private:
		// variables in need of initialization to make valid object
		int i;
		float f;
		char c;

		// Only one simple constructor - rest is handled by Builder
		Product( const int i, const float f, const char c ) : i(i), f(f), c(c){}

	public:
		// Product specific functionality
		void print();
		void doSomething();
		void doSomethingElse();
};


class Product::Builder{
	private:
		// variables needed for construction of object of Product class
		int i;
		float f;
		char c;

	public:
		// default values for variables
		static const int defaultI = 1;
		static const float defaultF = 3.1415f;
		static const char defaultC = 'a';

		// create Builder with default values assigned
		// (in C++11 they can be simply assigned above on declaration instead)
		Builder() : i( defaultI ), f( defaultF ), c( defaultC ){}

		// sets custom values for Product creation
		// returns Builder for shorthand inline usage (same way as cout &lt;&lt;)
		Builder&amp; setI( const int i ){ this-&gt;i = i; return *this; }
		Builder&amp; setF( const float f ){ this-&gt;f = f; return *this; }
		Builder&amp; setC( const char c ){ this-&gt;c = c; return *this; }

		// prepare specific frequently desired Product
		// returns Builder for shorthand inline usage (same way as cout &lt;&lt;)
		Builder&amp; setProductP(){
			this-&gt;i = 42;
			this-&gt;f = -1.0f/12.0f;
			this-&gt;c = '@';

			return *this;
		}

		// produce desired Product
		Product build(){
			// here optionaly check variable consistency
			// and also if Product is buildable from given information

			return Product( this-&gt;i, this-&gt;f, this-&gt;c );
		}
};



///// Product implementation (possibly Product.cpp) /////
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void Product::print(){
	using namespace std;

	cout &lt;&lt; "Product internals dump:" &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; "i: " &lt;&lt; this-&gt;i &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; "f: " &lt;&lt; this-&gt;f &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; "c: " &lt;&lt; this-&gt;c &lt;&lt; endl;
}

void Product::doSomething(){}
void Product::doSomethingElse(){}



//////////////////// Usage of Builder (replaces Director from diagram)
int main(){
	// simple usage
	Product p1 = Product::Builder().setI(2).setF(0.5f).setC('x').build();
	p1.print(); // test p1

	// advanced usage
	Product::Builder b;
	b.setProductP();
	Product p2 = b.build(); // get Product P object
	b.setC('!'); // customize Product P
	Product p3 = b.build();
	p2.print(); // test p2
	p3.print(); // test p3
}

Java Example[edit]


public class StreetMap {
	private final Point origin;
	private final Point destination;

	private final Color waterColor;
	private final Color landColor;
	private final Color highTrafficColor;
	private final Color mediumTrafficColor;

	public static class Builder {

The torpedo tube on HMS&#160;Holland 1


A torpedo tube is a cylinder shaped device for launching torpedoes. There are two main types of torpedo tube: underwater tubes fitted to submarines and some surface ships, and deck-mounted units (also referred to as torpedo launchers) installed aboard surface vessels. Deck-mounted torpedo launchers are usually designed for a specific type of torpedo, while submarine torpedo tubes are general-purpose launchers, and are often also capable of deploying mines and cruise missiles. Most modern launchers are standardised on a 12.75-inch (324&#160;mm) diameter for light torpedoes (deck mounted aboard ship) or a 21-inch (533&#160;mm) diameter for heavy torpedoes (underwater tubes), although other sizes of torpedo tube have been used: see Torpedo classes and diameters.

Submarine torpedo tube[edit]
A submarine torpedo tube is a more complex mechanism than a torpedo tube on a surface ship, because the tube has to accomplish the function of moving the torpedo from the normal atmospheric pressure within the submarine into the sea at the ambient pressure of the water around the submarine. Thus a submarine torpedo tube operates on the principle of an airlock.
Torpedo tube operation[edit]




A simplified diagram of a submarine torpedo tube


The diagram on the right illustrates the operation of a submarine torpedo tube. The diagram is somewhat simplified but does show the working of a submarine torpedo launch.
A torpedo tube has a considerable number of interlocks for safety reasons. For example, an interlock prevents the breech door and muzzle door from opening at the same time.
The submarine torpedo launch sequence is, in simplified form:




Submarine torpedo tube breech doors of USS Nautilus in their close position







MU90 Impact triple launcher onboard F221 Hessen, a modern Sachsen-class frigate of the German Navy






Rear torpedo tube of a former German Jaguar class Schnellboot (MTB)






Torpedo tubes of the French SNLE Redoutable: French submarines use pistons to push the torpedo outside the tube, instead of blowing it out with compressed air.



Open the breech door in the torpedo room. Load the torpedo into the tube.
Hook up the wire-guide connection and the torpedo power cable.
Shut and lock the breech door.
Turn on power to the torpedo. A minimum amount of time is required for torpedo warmup. Fire control programs are uploaded to the torpedo.
Flood the torpedo tube. This may be done manually or automatically, from sea or from tanks, depending on the class of submarine. The tube must be vented during this process to allow for complete filling and eliminate air pockets which could escape to the surface or cause damage when firing.
Open the equalizing valve to equalize pressure in the tube with ambient sea pressure.
Open the muzzle door. If the tube is set up for Impulse Mode the slide valve will open with the muzzle door. If Swim Out Mode is selected, the slide valve remains closed. The slide valve allows water from the ejection pump to enter the tube.
When the launch command is given and all interlocks are satisfied, the water ram operates, thrusting a large volume of water into the tube at high pressure, which ejects the torpedo from the tube with considerable force. Modern torpedoes have a safety mechanism that prevents activation of the torpedo unless the torpedo senses the required amount of G-force.
The power cable is severed at launch. However if a guidance wire is used, it remains connected through a drum of wire in the tube. Torpedo propulsion systems vary but electric torpedoes swim out of the tube on their own and are of a smaller diameter. 21" weapons with fuel-burning engines usually start outside of the tube.
Once outside the tube the torpedo begins its run toward the target as programmed by the fire control system. Attack functions are programmed but with wire guided weapons, certain functions can be controlled from the ship.
For wire-guided torpedoes, the muzzle door must remain open because the guidance wire is still connected to the inside of the breech door to receive commands from the submarine’s fire-control system. A wire cutter on the inside of the breech door is activated to release the wire and its protective cable. These are drawn clear of the ship prior to shutting the muzzle door.
The drain cycle is a reverse of the flood cycle. Water is returned to the ship's tanks and can be moved as necessary. The tube must be vented to completely drain the tube since it is usually by gravity.
Open the breech door and remove the remnants of the torpedo power cable and the guidance wire basket. The tube must be wiped dry to prevent a buildup of slime. This process is called "diving the tube" and tradition dictates that "ye who shoots, dives".
Shut and lock the breech door.

Spare torpedoes are stored behind the tube in racks.
Speed is a desirable feature of a torpedo loading system, but safety is paramount. There are various manual and hydraulic handling systems for loading torpedoes into the tubes. Prior to the Ohio&#160;class, US SSBNs utilized manual block and tackle which took about 15 minutes to load a tube. SSNs prior to the Seawolf&#160;class used a hydraulic system that was much faster and safer in conditions where the ship needed to maneuver.




The French destroyer Kersaint prepares to launch a torpedo in 1970


The German Type 212 submarine uses a new development of the water ram expulsion system, which ejects the torpedo with water pressure to avoid acoustic detection.

The Type 052C destroyer (NATO code name Luyang II class, or Lanzhou class after the lead ship) is a class of destroyer built by China. It features a four array AESA multi-function phased array radar for 360-degree coverage.[2] The radar is used in conjunction with vertically launched HHQ-9 long-range air defence missiles. The Type 052C was the first warship in the People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force to have true long-range fleet air defence capability.

Programme[edit]
The design for the Type 052C was approved in September 2001. The chief designer was believed to be Zhu Yingfu (朱英富), the director of the 701st Research Institute of the 7th Academy of China Shipbuilding Heavy Industrial Group; Pan Jingfu (潘镜芙), the designer for the previous three classes, had retired prior to the approval.
Two ships, Lanzhou (170) and Haikou (171) were constructed by Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai starting in 2002, and entering service by 2005. Production resumed at Hudong-Zhonghua Shipyard in Shanghai toward the end of the decade, with 4 more launched by 2012.[3] There were six more ships planned after Lanzhou (170) and Haikou (171). However, the hull of at least one planned ships was modified into newer Type 052D.
Design[edit]
The Type 052C used the same hull and propulsion as the preceding Type 052B destroyer, which had also been built by Jiangnan. While the Type 052B used a mixture of Russian and Chinese systems, the Type 052C used predominantly Chinese systems, with a few sensors being notable exceptions.
The Type 052C was designed for the fleet air defence role, and mounted the Type 348 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, and vertically launched HQ-9 air defence missiles. It also carried YJ-62 anti-ship missiles. All three were new aboard Chinese warships.
Aviation facilities included a rear hangar and flight deck for one Ka-28-A or Z-9 helicopter.
Combat system[edit]
The command and control system used by the Type 052C is unknown. Previous Chinese ships used derivatives of the French Thomson-CSF TAVITAC. The Type 052C may use an improved system to better engage anti-ship missiles, and to process data from its helicopter; the Ka-28 ASW helicopters must pass data back to its host ship for processing.
While the Chinese claim to have produced combat data systems based on the MIL-STD-1773 standard, the Type 052C likely uses current standard Chinese systems based on the MIL-STD-1553B standard. The Chinese claim these are versatile enough to be upgraded to MIL-STD-1773 later.
Missiles[edit]
The Type 052C carries 48 HQ-9 naval air defence missiles in eight 6-cell 'cold launched' vertical launch systems (VLS). The Chinese VLS has a lid for each launch cell, but uses the same cold launch mechanism for each cell.[4] This eliminates the revolver system used in Russian VLS, and one single point of failure. The Chinese claim this results in lower size, weight, and maintenance costs.
The HQ-9 is a Chinese medium- to long-range, active radar homing air defence missile with a maximum range of 200&#160;km.[5] The missile incorporates some technology from the Russian S-300. The naval HQ-9 appears to be identical to the land-based variant.
The destroyer also carries anti-ship missiles in two 4-cell launchers just forward of the hangar. It is not confirmed whether the missiles are YJ-85 or YJ-62. Unlike the launchers for previous Chinese anti-ship missiles, the Type 052C launchers are cylindrical rather than box-shaped.[4] Missiles are guided by a Russian MR331 Mineral-ME (NATO codename "Band Stand") fire-control radar atop the bridge and a "Light Bulb" datalink forward of the hangar. The MR331 Mineral-ME is also used on Sovremenny class destroyers to guide 3M80 Moskit cruise missiles.
Guns[edit]
The main gun is a Type 210 100 mm naval gun, derived from the French Creusot-Loire T100C, in a turret with a reduced radar cross-section design. It may engage surface targets, aircraft, and low speed missiles. The maximum rate of fire is 90 rounds/min. The gun may be laid automatically or manually. It is possible, but unlikely, that the Chinese laser-guided projectiles are in service with the gun. Infrared-guided projectiles are another possibility, but a single-feed design would reduce the rate of fire if mixed with unguided projectiles.
Close-in defence is provided by two seven-barrel 30&#160;mm Type 730 CIWS, one mounted forward of the bridge and one atop the hangar. Each gun has a maximum rate of fire of 4,600~5,800 rounds/min.
Anti-submarine systems[edit]
Two triple 324&#160;mm torpedo tubes are carried and may launch Yu-7 and ET52 light ASW torpedoes. The Type 726-4 decoy launcher system on the forward deck may fire ASW rockets, although this is not normally used.
Electronic countermeasures[edit]
The digital and solid state Type 726-4 decoy launcher system is mounted on the forward deck and consists of four launchers. Each launcher has 18 tubes arranged in three six-tube rows. Firing is typically controlled automatically by the combat data system, but a manual control console is also provided. The decoy launcher system may theoretically be linked to other subsystems, although whether this feature is incorporated in the Type 052C is unknown.
The primary role of the Type 726-4 is to launch chaff and decoys. However, atypically, it may also fire ASW rockets (against submarines, torpedoes, and frogmen), and even be used for shore bombardment.
The launchers on the Type 052C appear to be manually loaded; automatic reloaders exist for the Type 726-4.
The Type 052C may also carry the possible Israeli-derived NRJ6A ESM system. ECM missions may also be carried out by onboard UAVs.
Sensors[edit]
Radar[edit]
The ship is the first Chinese ship fitted with a multifunction Active Phased Array Radar with four antenna arrays, with a reported name Type 348 Radar.[citation needed] China originally imported a Ukrainian C-band active phased array radar for evaluation, but decided that the radar did not meet the Chinese requirement. Instead, China adopted a domestic S-band multifunction active phased array radar with four antenna arrays. The radar is developed by the Research Institute of Electronic Technology (also more commonly known as the 14th Institute) at Nanjing, Jiangsu province, and it is a successor to the 14th Institute's earlier developed Type H/LJG-346 SAPARS (Shipborne Active Phased Array Radar System) that was completed in 1998. Chinese discovered that the S-band adopted by the American AN/SPY-1 passive phased array could be better suited for the requirements for the active phased array radar as well. The radar has reported name of Type 348 Radar and a maximum range of 450&#160;km, and a maximum resolution of 0.5 metres.[citation needed] However, under an earlier but completely different contract, Ukraine did provide cooling technologies for the antenna to China. According to many Chinese claims on the internet, the name assigned for Type 348 radar is Sea Lion, but others claim the name only applies to the export version.
The same Kavant Design Bureau of Ukraine that had provided China with cooling technologies for the radar antenna earlier also provided technical expertise in integrating the active phased array radar with ESM and the anti-stealth radar with Yagi antenna, which in turn, is a successor to the earlier Type 517H-1 (NATO codename: Knife Rest) long-range 2D air search radar. This metre-wave radar operates in the VHF band and is designated as Type 517M by the Chinese. Like the Type 348 Radar, this radar is also totally by China, and Chinese claim that it has better performance than the similar land-based JY-27 radar, which its accuracy is 150 meters for distance, one degree for angle, and its maximum range is 330&#160;km. Type 517M radar, in contrast, has a maximum range of 350&#160;km, but China has not released the details of its accuracy.
A Russian MR331 Mineral-ME (with NATO reporting name Band Stand) fire-control radar (for anti-ship missile and for the main gun as its secondary mission) was capable of over the horizon targeting, and it has been installed on other newly built PLAN ships including Type 054A frigate. The Type 344 Radar is installed to provide fire control for the main gun, and for the Type 730 CIWS as its secondary mission in case the locally mounted fire control radars for the CIWS malfunctioned or damaged in battles. Two locally mounted LR66/TR47C radars derived from Type 347 Radar provide fire control for the Type 730 CIWS, and although these radars are also capable of providing fire control for the main gun, it is not known if such capability has been incorporated via the combat data system. Type 364 Radar is installed in a radome for air and surface search, and this radar acts as a supplement of the Type 348 Radar and as a provider of target information for SAM and CIWS, while also have the anti-ship missile targeting as its secondary mission.
Electro-optical (Optronics)[edit]
The OFC (Optical Fire Control) -3 electro-optical fire control system is a modular design that consists of a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can be replaced by a laser designator (for the laser beam riding SAM), the TV camera can be replaced by a night vision camera, and the IR camera can be replaced by an ImIR, at higher cost. Development to incorporate the dual band IR, night vision camera, and the color TV camera has been successfully completed, but it is unclear if these newly developed versions will be installed on any of the ships. The OFC-3 optronics is designed by the Central China Optronic (electro-optical) Research Institute. Although the advanced versions have been successfully tested, only the most basic version have been installed on board Type 052C class, as acknowledged by the developer, and domestic Chinese media rumored the main reason was to reduce the cost. However, the adaptation of the most basic version of OFC-3 results in great decrease in the performance and effectiveness of the main gun, because without the laser designator needed, laser beam riding and semi-active laser guided projectiles can not be deployed for the Type 210 100 mm naval gun.
The OFC-3 Electro-optical system is further supplemented by the IR-17 Infrared Surveillance Device optronics, which is an infrared system only, and like OFC-3 system, it has also been installed on Luzhou class destroyer and Guangzhou class destroyer. The IR-17 system is usually installed on the forward mast just below the 3-D air search radar, and it consists of three parts: sensor head, operator console and electronic cabinet that contains other electronics including power supply. In comparison to OFC-3, more information is released on IR-17, including:

Sensor head weight: &lt; 160&#160;kg
Control console weight: &lt; 390&#160;kg
Electrical cabinet weight: &lt; 300&#160;kg
Sensor head size: 0.6 m x 0.9 m x 1.1 m
Control console size: 0.72 m x 1.05 m x 1.65 m
Electrical cabinet size: 0.6 m x 0.7 m x 1.65 m
Accuracy: 3 mrad
Range against sea-skimming anti-ship missile with 0.1 square meter radar cross section: &gt; 8&#160;km
Range against cruise missile: &gt; 20&#160;km
Range against aircraft with 3 square meter radar cross section: &gt; 30&#160;km

The JRSCCS integrated command and control system is used to direct both the OFC-3 and IR-17. In addition, the system can also be used to direct all on board weaponry and sensors, though as only an emergency backup measure for the combat data system, which JRSCCS integrated command and control system is linked to. The JRSCCS system is full automatic and only require a single operator when necessary. The operator console of the JRSCCS is designated as JRMC and consists of two multifunction color displays and a joy stick, and up to five JRMC consoles can be deployed when required. According to the developer, such five consoles arrangement as the emergency backup of combat data system is located separately from the main combat information center where the combat data system is located to ensure survivability, but it is not known for sure if this configuration had been adopted for Type 052C destroyer.
Like the H/ZBJ-1 combat data system on board, the JRSCCS is distributed and redundant and reflects both Russian and Western influence. From the Russian/Soviet tradition, each sensor handles as much of its own data processing as possible. While this potentially allows the design of individual system components to be simplified, the Chinese followed the Western tradition by ensuring central components can still process all information from the sensors in the event of sensor hardware malfunction. The cost of such redundancy is such that half the price of the ship is in its C4I systems. Another Western design tradition incorporated was the use of an open architecture software design.
Sonar[edit]
Like the Sovremenny class destroyers, the ASW weaponry on board Type 052C destroyer is mainly for self-defense, since it is a class of air-defense destroyer. The ship is equipped with hull-mounted SJD-8/9 medium-frequency hull-mounted active–passive sonar, which is a development of French DUBV-23 sonar, and the improvements in both the hardware and the software over the original French design enabled the sonar to be used as a torpedo approaching warning system as well. When in active mode, the range of the hull-mounted sonar is at least 12&#160;km or greater, and when in passive mode, the range is at least 60&#160;km or greater, a 20% increase to the 50&#160;km maximum range of the Russian–Soviet MGK-355 Platina sonar on board Sovremenny class destroyers. Encrypted underwater telephone and other communication gears are installed on board to enable this class to be better coordinated with submarines in joint maneuvers.
Although both variable-depth sonar such as ESS-1 medium-frequency VDS (the Chinese development of French DUBV-43 VDS) and H/SJG-206 linear towed-array sonar were successfully tested on board, these were abandoned because incorporating these extra sonars would lead to significant redesign of the hull and increased cost. Despite the fact that the extra processing capability reserved in the combat data system for the towed sonar and VDS when needed, it is highly unlikely that the towed sonar and VDS would ever be incorporated in the near future. The high frequency obstacle–mine avoidance sonar once originally planned to equip this class failed to materialize due to the same financial concern of reducing the cost.
Two models of airborne dipping sonars can be carried by on board Ka-27 helicopters, both being the derivatives of Russian / Soviet V-3 medium frequency (MF) Ros' sonar (also known as Rys, with NATO reporting name Lamb Tail), with a range around 7&#160;km. Original sonars on board Ka-27 were Russian VGS-3K models marketed by Morfizpribor, while Chinese military enthusiasts have claimed (but yet to be confirmed) that H-3 models of Ukrainian firm Sokol is also purchased by China to diversify supplier sources. Unconfirmed claims by Chinese military enthusiasts also suggest that Russian firm Morfizpribor is actively marketing its 180&#160;kg class Vesta-K low frequency (LF) airborne sonar to China as an upgrade to the original VGS-3K Ros' sonar, which would significantly boost the performance by increasing the range by tenfold to 50&#160;km, and with greater operating depth to 700 meters. However, the drawback of Russian–Soviet airborne sonar is that the information gathered cannot be processed on board the aircraft, so the process in done on board the ship instead. In contrast, the French Thomson-CSF-built HS-12 used on sonar Harbin Z-9 has a range in excess of a dozen kilometers and information gathered can be processed directly on board the helicopter. During upgrades, HS-12 sonar was subsequently replaced by the Chinese copy of French HS-312 sonar, which is an improvement of the original HS-12, with added capability of processing extra information of 4 to 8 sonar buoys, in addition to information of HS-12 sonar itself. This Chinese version of HS-312 sonar is also installed on Changhe Z-8 during latter's upgrade.
UAV[edit]
According to Chinese advertisements released during various defense / aerospace / electronic exhibitions in the past, conversion kits have been developed for destroyers to deploy multiple UAVs. The developers of both the JRSCCS and the combat data system have claimed that their products could handle the information needed to control UAVs. However, it is highly unlikely that any long range UAVs will ever be deployed on board this class because the complete handling system to support these large UAVs would need the entire hangar, thus displacing the only helicopter on board. Chinese governmental media, however, did release photos of a variety of propeller driven light UAVs being launched from destroyers and claimed that these light UAVs could be deployed on every destroyer class currently in Chinese service, and some of the pictures have depicted some UAVs carry laser targeting pods, providing guidance for laser guided projectiles. However, as of mid-2007, it still can not be confirmed that if any light UAVs has been on board Type 052C class on a regular basis. The lack of regular deployment of UAVs on board only seems to confirm the claim that the laser guided projectiles for the main gun are not deployed due to the lack of associating guidance equipment. On August 17, 2008, another type of UAV named as Hummingbird carrying electro-optical pod were deployed on board for the successful test of a new data link developed by China Northern Co. (中国北方公司). The new data link is a two-way real-time encrypted data link designed to replace the current HN-900 data link, and it is designated as NCTDL, short for Naval Common Tactical Data Link. The new data link is claimed by many Chinese to be at least equal to the Link 16, and even comparable to Link 22, but such claims have yet to be verified by both the Chinese government and sources outside China. However, it is certain that the new data link will replace HN-900 currently in service on board PLAN ships.
Aircraft[edit]
The ship’s stern hangar accommodates 1 Kamov Ka-28 (export version of the Kamov Ka-27, NATO codename: Helix) antisubmarine warfare (ASW) helicopter, or alternatively, 1 Z-9 ASW helicopter (Chinese version of the Eurocopter Dauphin AS 365N), and both type can carry various weapons including torpedoes and depth charges. The Ka-28 helicopter can operate in all weather conditions up to 200&#160;km from the host ship, but its onboard dipping sonar only has half the range of the Chinese copy of the French dipping sonar on board Z-9, furthermore, it lacks the processing capability to process the information gathered, so the information has to be passed back to the host ship for processing via data links, while in contrast, Z-9 can process information gathered on board the helicopter, but with shorter range. Z-9 can process information on board because it is equipped with IPS, short for Integrated Processing System, which is essentially an airborne version of combat data system, which also is a subsystem of the combat data system on board the mother ship. Type 052C is the first warship in Chinese navy to be equipped with IPS, and after evaluation which judged to be successful, IPS is fitted to all other Z-9 helicopters in Chinese navy during scheduled upgrades.
Although the sensors and weaponry carried by both helicopters are somewhat comparable to their western counterparts, the overall capabilities as ASW platforms for these helicopters are seriously hampered due to the installation of their radars: unlike the western belly-mounted radars with 360-degree coverage, the radars for Ka-28 and Z-9 are chin-mounted and nose-mounted respectively, thus creating huge blind spots. In order to overcome these blind spots, Ka-28 and Z-9 must fly in very complicated flight patterns, resulting in significant fuel consumption, thus decreasing the endurance and range in comparison to western ASW helicopters. In addition, the capabilities of both type ASW helicopters are also serious reduced due to cost cutting measures which resulted in deletion of towed sonar array despite successful test on board. H/SJG-206 linear towed sonar array has a range of in excess of 100 kilometers, and abandonment of this effective ASW gear means that the defense perimeter of Type 052C is shrunk more than 100 kilometers, and Z-9/Ka-27 must loiter closer to the mother ship to fill that gap, thus cannot be deployed to the further away from ship like their western counterparts. Such limitation would lead to potential threats being much closer to the mother ship than that of the west, exposing Type 052C in greater danger to attacks in comparison to western ships equipped with towed sonar array, hence greatly reduced the overall effectiveness of the ship/aircraft performance.
Propulsion[edit]
The first two ships' propulsion is in the form of CODOG, consisting of two Ukraine-made DA80/DN80 gas turbines each rated at ~32,600&#160;hp(24&#160;MW) and two Shaanxi diesel engines (Chinese licensed production of the MTU 20V956TB92) each rated at ~6,700&#160;hp (5&#160;MW). The DA80/DN80 gas turbine is the export version of UGT-25000 of Ukrainian Zorya-Mashprocket State State Enterprise Gas Turbine Research &amp; Production Complex, purchased by China in the late 1990s as part of license-production in China. [1] The UGT25000 has power rating of 25-27MW depending on configuration [2], but could only provide 24MW upon delivery because development was not fully completed when they were sold to China. A total of eight units were originally purchased and Chinese sources have claimed that all had been upgraded, mainly in the area of turbine blade production techniques, and such update had greatly increased reliability and maintainability. The main parameters of DA80/DN80 included:

length: 6.4 meter
Width: 2.5 meter
Height: 2.7 meter
Weight: 16 tons
Efficiency: 36.5%
Exhaust gas flow: 90&#160;kg / second
Exhaust temperature: 465ºС

The Phalanx CIWS is a close-in weapon system for defense against anti-ship missiles. It was designed and manufactured by the General Dynamics Corporation, Pomona Division[4] (now a part of Raytheon). Consisting of a radar-guided 20&#160;mm Gatling gun mounted on a swiveling base, the Phalanx has been used by multiple navies around the world, notably the United States Navy on every class of surface combat ship, by the British Royal Navy in its older escorts (where weight limits the use of the heavier Dutch Goalkeepers 30 mm CIWS), by the United States Coast Guard aboard its Hamilton-class and Legend-class cutters, and the navies of 16 allied nations.
A land based variant, known as C-RAM, has recently been deployed in a short range missile defense role, to counter incoming rockets and artillery fire.[6]
Because of their distinctive barrel-shaped radome and their automated nature of operation, Phalanx CIWS units are sometimes nicknamed "R2-D2" after the famous droid character from the Star Wars films.[7][8]

History[edit]
The Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS) was developed as the last line of automated weapons defense (terminal defense or point defense) against anti-ship missiles (AShMs or ASMs) and attacking aircraft, including high-g and maneuvering sea-skimmers. The first prototype system was offered to the U.S. Navy for evaluation on the USS&#160;King in 1973 and it was determined that additional improvements were required to improve performance and reliability. Subsequently, the Phalanx Operational Suitability Model successfully completed its Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&amp;E) on board the USS&#160;Bigelow in 1977. The model exceeded operational maintenance, reliability, and availability specifications. Another evaluation successfully followed, and the weapon system was approved for production in 1978. Phalanx production started with orders for 23 USN and 14 foreign military systems. The first ship fully fitted out was the aircraft carrier USS&#160;Coral Sea in 1980. The Navy began placing CIWS systems on non-combatant vessels in 1984.
Design[edit]
The basis of the system is the 20 mm M61 Vulcan Gatling gun autocannon, used since 1959 by the United States military on various tactical aircraft, linked to a Ku-band radar system for acquiring and tracking targets. This proven system was combined with a purpose-made mounting, capable of fast elevation and traverse speeds, to track incoming targets. An entirely self-contained unit, the mounting houses the gun, an automated fire-control system and all other major components, enabling it to automatically search for, detect, track, engage, and confirm kills using its computer-controlled radar system. Due to this self-contained nature, Phalanx is ideal for support ships, which lack integrated targeting systems and generally have limited sensors. The entire unit has a mass between 12,400 and 13,500&#160;lb (5,500 to 6,100&#160;kg).
Upgrades[edit]




Rounds from a Mk-15 Phalanx CIWS from the guided-missile destroyer USS Mitscher (DDG 57) impact the ex-USNS Saturn (T-AFS-10) during a sinking exercise (SINKEX), 2010.


Due to the continuing evolution of both threats and computer technology, the Phalanx system has, like most military systems, been developed through a number of different configurations. The basic (original) style is the Block 0, equipped with first-generation, solid-state electronics and with marginal capability against surface targets. The Block 1 (1988) upgrade offered various improvements in radar, ammunition, computing power, rate of fire, and an increase in maximum engagement elevation to +70 degrees. These improvements were intended to increase the system's capability against emerging Russian supersonic anti-ship missiles. Block 1A introduced a new computer system to counter more maneuverable targets. The Block 1B PSuM (Phalanx Surface Mode, 1999) adds a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor to allow the weapon to be used against surface targets.[9] This addition was developed to provide ship defense against small vessel threats and other "floaters" in littoral waters and to improve the weapon's performance against slower low-flying aircraft. The FLIR's capability is also of use against low-observability missiles and can be linked with the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) system to increase RAM engagement range and accuracy. The Block 1B also allows for an operator to visually identify and target threats.[9]
As the system model manager, the U.S. Navy is in the process of upgrading all their Phalanx systems to the Block 1B configuration. All Phalanx systems in use by the U.S. Navy are scheduled to be upgraded to Block 1B by the end of FY 2015. In addition to the FLIR sensor, the Block 1B incorporates an automatic acquisition video tracker, optimized gun barrels (OGB), and Enhanced Lethality Cartridges (ELC) for additional capabilities against asymmetric threats such as small maneuvering surface craft, slow-flying fixed and rotary-winged aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The FLIR sensor improves performance against anti-ship cruise missiles, while the OGB and ELC provide tighter dispersion and increased "first-hit" range; the Mk 244 ELC is specifically designed to penetrate anti-ship missiles with a 44-percent-heavier tungsten penetrator round and an aluminum nose piece. Another system upgrade is the Phalanx 1B Baseline 2 radar to improve detection performance, increase reliability, and reduce maintenance. It also has a surface mode to track, detect, and destroy threats closer to the water's surface, increasing the ability to defend against fast-attack boats and low-flying missiles; the Baseline 2 radar upgrade is to be installed on all U.S. Navy Phalanx system-equipped vessels by FY 2019.[10] The Block 1B is also used by other navies, such as Canada, Portugal, Japan, Egypt, Bahrain, and the UK.[11]
In May 2009, the US Navy awarded a $260 million contract to Raytheon Missile Systems to perform upgrades and other work on the Phalanx.[12]

The CIWS is designed to be the last line of defense against anti-ship missiles. Due to its design criteria, its effective range is very short relative to the range of modern ASMs, from 1 to 5 nautical miles (9&#160;km). The gun mount moves at a very high speed and with great precision. The system takes minimal inputs from the ship, making it capable of functioning, despite potential damage to the ship. The only inputs required for operation are 440 V AC Three-phase electric power at 60 Hz and water (for electronics cooling). For full operation, including some non-essential functions, it also has inputs for true compass ship's heading and 115 V AC for the PASS subsystem.

Radar subsystems[edit]
The CIWS has two antennas that work together to engage targets. The first antenna, for searching, is located inside the radome on the weapon control group (top of the white-painted portion). The search subsystem provides bearing, range, velocity, heading, and altitude information of potential targets to the CIWS computer. This information is analyzed to determine whether the detected object should be engaged by the CIWS system. Once the computer identifies a valid target (see details below), the mount moves to face the target and then hands the target over to the tracking antenna. The track antenna is extremely precise, but views a much smaller area. The tracking subsystem observes the target until the computer determines that the probability of a successful hit is maximized and then, depending on the operator conditions, the system will either fire automatically or will recommend fire to the operator. While firing, the system tracks outgoing rounds and 'walks' them onto the target.

Gun and ammunition handling system[edit]
The Block 0 CIWS mounts (hydraulic driven) fired at a rate of 3,000 rounds per minute and held 989 rounds in the magazine drum.[4] The Block 1 CIWS mounts (hydraulic) also fired at 3,000 rounds per minute with an extended magazine drum holding 1,550 rounds. The Block 1A and newer (pneumatic driven) CIWS mounts fire at a rate of 4,500 rounds per minute with a 1,550-round magazine. The velocity of the rounds fired is approximately 3,600 feet per second (1,100&#160;m/s). The rounds are armor-piercing tungsten penetrator rounds or depleted uranium with discarding sabots. The Phalanx CIWS 20&#160;mm rounds are designed to destroy a missile's airframe and make it unaerodynamic, thus keeping shrapnel from the exploding projectile to a minimum, effectively keeping collateral damage to a minimum. The ammunition handling system has two conveyor belt systems. The first takes the rounds out of the magazine drum to the gun; the second takes empty shells or non-fired rounds to the opposite end of the drum.
CIWS contact target identification[edit]
The CIWS does not recognize identification friend or foe, also known as IFF. The CIWS only has the data it collects in real time from the radars to decide if the target is a threat and to engage it. A contact has to meet multiple criteria for it to be considered a target. Some of the criteria are listed below:




A sailor sits at a CIWS Local Control Panel (LCP) during a general quarters drill.



Is the range of the target increasing or decreasing in relation to the ship? The CIWS search radar will see contacts that are out-bound and discard them. The CIWS will engage a target only if it is approaching the ship.
Is the contact capable of maneuvering to hit the ship? If a contact is not heading directly at the ship, the CIWS looks at its heading in relation to the ship and its velocity. It then decides if the contact can still perform a maneuver to hit the ship.
Is the contact traveling between the minimum and maximum velocities? The CIWS has the ability to engage targets that travel in a wide range of speeds; however, it is not an infinitely wide range. The system has a target maximum-velocity limit. If a target exceeds this velocity, the CIWS will not engage it. It also has a target minimum-velocity limit. Any contact below that velocity will also not be engaged by the CIWS. The operator also has the option to adjust the minimum and maximum limits within the limits of the system.

There are many other subsystems that together ensure proper operation, such as environmental control, transmitter, mount movement control, power control and distribution, and so on. It takes six to eight months to train a technician to maintain, operate, and repair the CIWS.
Incidents[edit]
Drone exercise catastrophic accidents[edit]
On 10 February 1983, the USS&#160;Antrim was conducting a live-fire exercise off the East Coast of the United States using the Phalanx against a target drone. Although the drone was successfully engaged at close range, the target debris bounced off the sea surface and struck the ship. This caused significant damage and fire from the drone's residual fuel, which also killed a civilian instructor aboard this ship.[16][17]
On 11 October 1989, the USS&#160;El Paso was conducting a live-fire exercise off the East Coast of the United States using the Phalanx against a target drone. The drone was successfully engaged, but as the drone fell to the sea, the CIWS re-engaged it as a continued threat to the El Paso. Rounds from the Phalanx struck the bridge of the USS&#160;Iwo Jima, killing one officer and injuring a petty officer.[18]
Iraqi missile attack in 1991 Gulf War[edit]
On 25 February 1991, during the first Gulf War, the Phalanx-equipped frigate USS&#160;Jarrett was a few miles from the US battleship USS&#160;Missouri and the British destroyer HMS&#160;Gloucester. The ships were attacked by an Iraqi Silkworm missile (often referred to as the Seersucker), at which time the Missouri fired its SRBOC chaff. The Phalanx system on Jarrett, operating in the automatic target-acquisition mode, fixed on Missouri's chaff, releasing a burst of rounds. From this burst, four rounds hit Missouri which was two to three miles (about 5&#160;km) from Jarrett at the time. There were no injuries.[19] A Sea Dart missile was then launched from Gloucester in a 'tail end' engagement; destroying the Iraqi missile as it passed between Gloucester and Missouri, achieving the first successful engagement of a missile by a missile during combat at sea.

Accidental downing of US aircraft by the Japanese destroyer Yūgiri[edit]
On 4 June 1996, a Japanese Phalanx accidentally shot down a US A-6 Intruder from the USS&#160;Independence that was towing a radar target during gunnery exercises about 1,500 miles west of the main Hawaiian island of Oahu. A Phalanx aboard the Asagiri class destroyer Yūgiri locked onto the Intruder instead of the target. Both pilots ejected safely.[20] A post-accident investigation concluded that the Yūgiri's gunnery officer gave the order to fire before the A-6 was out of the CIWS engagement envelope.[21][22]
21st century[edit]
Centurion C-RAM[edit]




Centurion C-RAM


Seeking a solution to constant rocket and mortar attacks on bases in Iraq, the United States Army requested a quick-to-field anti-projectile system in May 2004, as part of its Counter-Rocket, Artillery, Mortar initiative.[23] The end result of this program was 'Centurion'. For all intents and purposes, a terrestrial version of the Navy's CIWS, the Centurion was rapidly developed,[24] with a proof-of-concept test in November that same year. It began deployment to Iraq in 2005,[23][25] where it was set up to protect forward operating bases and other high-value sites in and around the capital, Baghdad.[26] Israel has purchased a single system for testing purposes, and was reported[27] to have considered buying the system to counter rocket attacks and defend point military installations. However, the swift and effective development and performance of Israel's indigenous Iron dome system has ruled out any purchase or deployment of Centurion.
Each system consists of a modified Phalanx 1B CIWS, powered by an attached generator and mounted on a trailer for mobility. Armed with a 20 mm M61A1 Gatling gun, the unit is capable of firing 4,500 20&#160;mm rounds per minute.[6][28] In 2008, there were more than 20 CIWS systems protecting bases in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. A Raytheon spokesman told Navy Times that 105 attacks were defeated by the systems, most of those involved mortars. Based on the success of Centurion, 23 additional systems were ordered in September 2008.[29]
Like the naval (1B) version, Centurion uses Ku-band radar and FLIR[30] to detect and track incoming projectiles, and is also capable of engaging surface targets, with the system able to reach a minus-25-degree elevation.[30] The Centurion is reportedly capable of defending a 0.5&#160;mi square area.[31] One major difference between the land- and sea-based variants is the choice of ammunition. Whereas naval Phalanx systems fire tungsten armor-piercing rounds, the C-RAM uses the 20&#160;mm HEIT-SD (High-Explosive Incendiary Tracer, Self-Destruct) ammunition, originally developed for the M163 Vulcan Air Defense System.[24][32] These rounds explode on impact with the target, or on tracer burnout, thereby greatly reducing the risk of collateral damage should any rounds fail to hit their target.[24][33] the SeaRAM is equipped with an 11-cell RAM launcher, and provides defense at a longer range. Due to the common mounting, SeaRAM inherits the relatively easy installation characteristics of its gun-based sibling, with Raytheon stating that "[SeaRAM] fits the exact shipboard installation footprint of the Phalanx, uses the same power and requires minimal shipboard modification."[34] Currently in the trial stages, SeaRAM is fitted to the Independence Class Littoral Combat Ship.[34]

			Tailgating
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				This article is about driving too close.  For other uses, see Tailgate.




A typical example of tailgating. A BMW is being followed very closely by another car (with faulty brake lights)


Tailgating is the practice of driving on a road too close to a frontward vehicle, at a distance which does not guarantee that stopping to avoid collision is possible.
The safe distance for following another vehicle varies depending on various factors including vehicle speed, weather, visibility, and other road conditions. Some jurisdictions may require a minimal gap of a specified distance or time interval. When following heavy vehicles, or in less than ideal conditions (e.g. low light or rain), a longer distance is recommended.

Causes[edit]
There can be several reasons for tailgating.
Negligence[edit]
Tailgating can occur because of a lack of perceived risk in so doing. Thus, it is done unconsciously or negligently, very often by people who consider themselves safe drivers and generally obey the other rules of the road. Evidence shows that more experienced drivers are more likely to be involved in rear-end collisions, possibly because they overestimate their skill and become complacent about allowing sufficient distance to avoid an accident.[1]
Coercion[edit]
In its worst form, it can be a particularly violent form of road rage and a form of intimidation. An example would be where the tailgating driver (the driver in the following vehicle) threatens damage to the leading vehicle and its occupants by driving aggressively — perhaps also with use of headlights and horn — to bully the leading vehicle's driver to get out of the way. The driver being tailgated might not wish to comply, especially if doing so would involve breaking the law, such as by increasing speed beyond the speed limit or changing lanes without due regard for safety. Note, however, that in some jurisdictions flashing high beams is a normal and polite method used to signal the intention to overtake.[1] Tailgating can also be dangerous to the tailgater, especially if he or she is driving closely behind a large vehicle (such as a tractor-trailer, or gas tanker). If the leading vehicle decelerates suddenly (such as when encountering a traffic jam, traffic lights, avoiding pedestrians, etc.), the tailgater has a high risk of causing a rear-end collision.
Aerodynamics[edit]
A form of deliberate tailgating known as slipstreaming, "draft-assisted forced stop", or "draft-assisted forced auto stop" (D-FAS) is a technique which has been used by people known as hypermilers to achieve greater fuel economy. D-FAS involves turning off the engine and gliding in neutral while tailgating a larger vehicle, in order to take advantage of the reduced wind resistance in its immediate wake.[2] Note that this practice is extremely dangerous: while tailgating itself is inherently risky, the danger of collision is increased with D-FAS as power for power brakes can be lost after a few applications of the brake pedal and, with older cars, the pressure that causes power steering to function can be lost as well.[3]
Trailing and columns[edit]
Another instance whereby the practice of driving on a road very close to a frontward vehicle or at a close distance may occur is during an occasion whereby the drivers of the two cars are acquainted to one another. This may be due to it being a procession of motor vehicles, typically carrying or escorting a prominent person that wants to avoid interlopers. Another instance may occur where the leading vehicle is showing directions to the trailing vehicle and the trailing vehicle attempts to avoid allowing an interloping vehicle to come in between them.[4] Another sphere wherein tailgating has been observed is among drivers who are in a hurry, or other public road activity whose prerequisite is urgency or agitation.[5]
Fighting against tailgating[edit]
Tailgating causes most rear-end crashes in South Australia.[6] The United Kingdom and Australia are trialing certain road markings which can help resolve this problem. Consisting of an arrangement of chevrons, these remind the driver not to tailgate.[7]
In Germany tailgating is punishable with a fine of up to 400 €. In case of gross negligence one or more penalty points are given and the driver's license may additionally be immediately suspended for up to 3 months.[8]

Lithium hydroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula LiOH. It is a white hygroscopic crystalline material. It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol, and is the weakest base among the alkali metal hydroxides. It is available commercially in anhydrous form and as the monohydrate (LiOH.H2O), both of which are strong bases.

Production and reactions[edit]
Lithium hydroxide is produced in a metathesis reaction between lithium carbonate and calcium hydroxide:[5]

Li2CO3 + Ca(OH)2 → 2 LiOH + CaCO3

The initially produced hydrate is dehydrated by heating under vacuum up to 180&#160;°C.
In the laboratory, lithium hydroxide arises by the action of water on lithium or lithium oxide. The equations for these processes follow:

2 Li + 2 H2O → 2 LiOH + H2
Li2O + H2O → 2 LiOH

Typically, these reactions are avoided.
Although lithium carbonate is more widely used, the hydroxide is an effective precursor to lithium salts, e.g.

LiOH + HF → LiF + H2O.

Applications[edit]
Lithium hydroxide is mainly consumed for the production of lithium greases. A popular lithium grease is lithium stearate, which is a general-purpose lubricating grease due to its high resistance to water and usefulness at both high and low temperatures.
Carbon dioxide scrubbing[edit]
Further information: carbon dioxide scrubber
Lithium hydroxide is used in breathing gas purification systems for spacecraft, submarines, and rebreathers to remove carbon dioxide from exhaled gas by producing lithium carbonate and water:[6]

2 LiOH·H2O + CO2 → Li2CO3 + 3 H2O

Or,

2LiOH + CO2 → Li2CO3 + H2O

The latter, anhydrous hydroxide, is preferred for its lower mass and lesser water production for respirator systems in spacecraft. One gram of anhydrous lithium hydroxide can remove 450&#160;cm3 of carbon dioxide gas. The monohydrate loses its water at 100–110&#160;°C.
Other uses[edit]
It is used as a heat transfer medium and as a storage-battery electrolyte. It is also used in ceramics and some Portland cement formulations. Lithium hydroxide (isotopically enriched in lithium-7) is used to alkalize the reactor coolant in pressurized water reactors for corrosion control.

Viacom Inc. (short for Visual &amp; Audio Communications) was an American media conglomerate. Effective December 31, 2005, this corporate entity changed its name to CBS Corporation. The present firm also known as Viacom was also established at that date and is a new spin-off company created during the CBS-Viacom split.
Viacom was highly profitable during the 1970s and 1980s distributing old CBS classics to syndication, including such landmark shows as I Love Lucy, The Andy Griffith Show, The Twilight Zone and All in the Family (which was later owned by Columbia Pictures Television, now called Sony Pictures Television). They also syndicated shows for others, the biggest examples being The Cosby Show and Roseanne (which were produced by Carsey-Werner Productions, who eventually began distributing their own programming).

History[edit]
The original Viacom began as CBS Films, Inc., the television syndication division of CBS established in 1952. The division was spun off and renamed Viacom in 1971, amid new FCC rules forbidding television networks from owning syndication companies[1] (the rules were later repealed).
String of acquisitions[edit]
Viacom's first non-programming acquisition came in 1978 when the company purchased the Sonderling Broadcasting chain, giving it radio stations in New York City, Washington, D.C., Houston, and San Francisco, and one television station, WAST (now WNYT) in Albany, New York.
Later that year, Viacom added WHNB-TV in New Britain, Connecticut, changing its call letters to WVIT. The early 1980s saw Viacom sorting through the Sonderling stations with several being donated, swapped, or being the nucleus for new corporations—for example, WOL in Washington launched the Radio One group, which today is the largest African-American-owned broadcasting corporation.
In 1983, Viacom purchased KSLA-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana, and WHEC-TV in Rochester, New York, in separate transactions, followed in 1986 with (ironically) CBS-owned KMOX-TV in St. Louis; with the purchase, that station's call letters were changed to KMOV.
In 1985, Viacom bought Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which owned MTV and Nickelodeon, renaming the company MTV Networks. Viacom also received Warner-Amex's share of Viacom/WASEC joint venture Showtime Networks, Inc, which included Showtime and The Movie Channel. This led to Viacom becoming a mass media company rather than simply a distribution company.
In 1986, movie theater owner National Amusements bought controlling interest in Viacom, which brought Sumner Redstone to the company. Redstone retained the Viacom name and made a string of large acquisitions in the early 1990s, announcing plans to merge with Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western), parent of Paramount Pictures, in 1993, and buying the Blockbuster Video chain in 1994.
The Blockbuster acquisition gave Viacom access to large television holdings controlled by Aaron Spelling's company, Spelling Entertainment; along with his own productions, Spelling controlled the pre-1973 ABC and NBC back catalogs by way of Worldvision Enterprises and Republic Pictures.
In 1999, Viacom made its biggest acquisition to date by announcing plans to merge with its former parent CBS Corporation. The merger was approved in 2000, bringing cable channels TNN (now Spike TV) and Country Music Television (CMT) under Viacom's wing, as well as CBS's production units and TV syndicaters Eyemark Entertainment (formerly Group W) and King World. CBS's production unit and King World (which has since folded Eyemark) operated under their own names; however, TNN and CMT were merged into MTV Networks almost immediately.
In 2001, Viacom completed its purchase of Black Entertainment Television (BET). As with TNN/Spike TV and CMT, it was immediately integrated into MTV Networks, causing some outcry among BET workers in the Washington area (where BET was based before the merger). As a result, BET was eventually de-integrated from MTV Networks.
Although a majority economic interest in Viacom was held by independent shareholders, the Redstone family maintained 71-percent voting control of the company through National Amusements' holdings of Viacom's stock.
In 2002, Viacom bought independently run music channel TMF, which at the time was broadcasting in Belgium and the Netherlands. In June 2004, Viacom bought VIVA Media AG, the German equivalent to MTV. The same month, plans were announced to dispose of Viacom's interest in Blockbuster later that year by means of an exchange offer.
Also in 2002, Viacom acquired the remaining shares of Infinity Broadcasting radio chain. And in April 2003, Viacom acquired the remaining ownership shares of Comedy Central from Time Warner, making Comedy Central integrated into MTV Networks.
2005 split[edit]

In March 2005, Viacom announced plans of looking into splitting the company into two publicly traded companies under the continuing ownership of National Amusements. The company was not only dealing with a stagnating stock price, but also the internal rivalry between Les Moonves and Tom Freston, longtime heads of CBS and MTV Networks respectively. After the departure of Mel Karmazin in 2004, Redstone, who served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, decided to split the offices of President and Chief Operating Officer between Moonves and Freston. Redstone was set to retire in the near future, and a split would be a creative solution to the matter of replacing him.
The split was approved by Viacom's board June 14, 2005, took effect December 31, 2005, and effectively reversed the Viacom/CBS merger of 1999. The existing Viacom was renamed CBS Corporation and was headed by Moonves. It now includes Viacom's "slow growth businesses", namely CBS, The CW (a merger of UPN and The WB), CBS Radio, Simon &amp; Schuster, CBS Outdoor (formerly Viacom Outdoor), Showtime, CBS Television Studios, CBS Television Distribution and CBS Studios International. These, according to some analysts[who?], were suffocating the growth of the MTV Networks cable businesses. The split effectively made CBS an independent company again.
In addition, CBS Corporation was given Paramount Parks (which they sold to amusement park operator Cedar Fair, L.P. on June 30, 2006) and the CBS College Sports Network.
Additionally, a new spin-off company was created called Viacom, which was headed by Freston. It comprises MTV Networks, BET Networks, Paramount's movie studio, and Paramount Pictures' home entertainment operations. These businesses are categorized as the high-growth businesses (MTV Networks and BET Networks in particular), and if they were split into a separate company, it could infuse new funds/capital to allow for future acquisitions and expansion.
In September 2006, Redstone fired Freston and named Philippe Dauman as the new head of Viacom.
Notes[edit]

Over the years, the pronunciation of the name Viacom has changed. As noted by Ralph Baruch, Viacom's first chairman, it was initially pronounced /ˈviː.əkɒm/ VEE-ə-kom. Subsequent to Sumner Redstone's National Amusements purchase of the company in 1986, the pronunciation favored by Redstone and included in its audible identification marks is pronounced /ˈvaɪ.əkɒm/ VY-ə-kom).[2]) However, this was not the first usage of this pronunciation; when Magnetic Video distributed material from Viacom's library, its logo incorporated the second pronunciation as part of the announcer spiel.

In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) in a class is a special type of subroutine called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set required member variables.
A constructor resembles an instance method, but it differs from a method in that it has no explicit return type, it is not implicitly inherited and it usually has different rules for scope modifiers. Constructors often have the same name as the declaring class. They have the task of initializing the object's data members and of establishing the invariant of the class, failing if the invariant is invalid. A properly written constructor leaves the resulting object in a valid state. Immutable objects must be initialized in a constructor.
Programmers also use the term constructor to denote one of the tags that wraps data in an algebraic data type. This is a different usage than in this article.[dubious – discuss]
Most languages allow overloading the constructor in that there can be more than one constructor for a class, with differing parameters. Some languages take consideration of some special types of constructors. Constructors, which concretely use a single class to create objects and return a new instance of the class, are abstracted by factories, which also create objects but can do so in various ways, using multiple classes or different allocation schemes such as an object pool.

Parameterized constructors[edit]
Constructors that can take arguments are termed as parameterized constructors. The number of arguments can be greater or equal to one(1). For example:


class Example
{
     int x, y;
   public:
     Example();
     Example(int a, int b); // Parameterized constructor
};
Example :: Example()
{
}
Example :: Example(int a, int b)
{
     x = a;
     y = b;
}

When an object is declared in a parameterized constructor, the initial values have to be passed as arguments to the constructor function. The normal way of object declaration may not work. The constructors can be called explicitly or implicitly. The method of calling the constructor implicitly is also called the shorthand method.


    Example e = Example(0, 50); // Explicit call

    Example e(0, 50);           // Implicit call

Default constructors[edit]
If the programmer does not supply a constructor for an instantiable class, most languages will provide a default constructor.
The behavior of the default constructor is language dependent. It may initialize data members to zero or other same values, or it may do nothing at all.
Some languages (Java, C#, VB .NET) will default construct arrays of class types to contain null references. Languages without null references may not allow default construction of arrays of non default constructible objects, or require explicit initialization at the time of the creation (C++):


#include &lt;iostream&gt;

struct not_default_constructible {
	not_default_constructible() = delete; // delete default constructor
	not_default_constructible(int x) { std::cout &lt;&lt; "Constructed with " &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; '\n'; }
};

int main() {
	not_default_constructible static_array[] =
		{ 1, 2, 3 };
	not_default_constructible *dynamic_array =
		new not_default_constructible[3]{ 4, 5, 6 }; // C++11
}

Copy constructors[edit]
See also: Copy constructor (C++)
Copy constructors define the actions performed by the compiler when copying class objects. A copy constructor has one formal parameter that is the type of the class (the parameter may be a reference to an object). It is used to create a copy of an existing object of the same class. Even though both classes are the same, it counts as a conversion constructor.
While copy constructors are usually abbreviated copy ctor or cctor, they have nothing to do with class constructors used in .NET using the same abbreviation.
Conversion constructors[edit]
Conversion constructors provide a means for a compiler to implicitly create an object belonging to one class based on an object of a different type. These constructors are usually invoked implicitly to convert arguments or operands to an appropriate type, but they may also be called explicitly.
Move constructors[edit]
In C++, move constructors take a value reference to an object of the class, and are used to implement ownership transfer of the parameter object's resources.
Syntax[edit]

Java, C++, C#, ActionScript, and PHP 4 have a naming convention in which constructors have the same name as the class of which they are associated with.
In PHP 5, a recommended name for a constructor is __construct. For backwards compatibility, a method with the same name as the class will be called if __construct method can not be found. Since PHP 5.3.3, this works only for non-namespaced classes.[1]
In Perl, constructors are, by convention, named "new" and have to do a fair amount of object creation.
In Moose object system for Perl, constructors (named new) are automatically created and are extended by specifying a BUILD method.
In Visual Basic .NET, the constructor is called "New".
In Python, the constructor is split over two methods, "__new__" and "__init__". The __new__ method is responsible for allocating memory for the instance, and receives the class as an argument (conventionally called "cls"). The __init__ method (often called "the initialiser") is passed the newly created instance as an argument (conventionally called "self").[2]
Object Pascal constructors are signified by the keyword "constructor" and can have user-defined names (but are mostly called "Create").
In Objective-C, the constructor method is split across two methods, "alloc" and "init" with the alloc method setting aside (allocating) memory for an instance of the class, and the init method handling the bulk of initializing the instance. A call to the method "new" invokes both the alloc and the init methods, for the class instance.

Memory organization[edit]
In Java, C# and VB .NET the constructor creates objects in a special memory structure called heap for reference types. Value types (such as int, double etc.), are created in a sequential structure called stack. VB .NET and C# allow use of new to create objects of value types. However, in those languages even use of new for value types creates objects only on stack.
In C++, when constructor is invoked without new the objects are created on stack. When objects are created using new they are created on heap. They must be deleted implicitly by a destructor or explicitly by a call to operator delete.
Language details[edit]
Java[edit]
In Java, constructors differ from other methods in that:

Constructors never have an explicit return type.
Constructors cannot be directly invoked (the keyword “new” invokes them).
Constructors cannot be synchronized, final, abstract, native, or static.

Java constructors perform the following tasks in the following order:

Initialize the class variables to default values. (byte, short, int, long, float, and double variables default to their respective zero values, booleans to false, chars to the null character ('\u0000') and object references to null.)
Call the default constructor of the superclass if no constructor is defined.
Initialize member variables to the specified values.
Executes the body of the constructor.

Java provides access to the superclass's constructor through the super keyword.


public class Example
{
    // Definition of the constructor.
    public Example()
    {
        this(1);
    }

    // Overloading a constructor
    public Example(int input)
    {
        data = input; // This is an assignment
    }

    // Declaration of instance variable(s).
    private int data;
}



// Code somewhere else
// Instantiating an object with the above constructor
Example e = new Example(42);

A constructor taking zero number of arguments is called a "no-arguments" or "no-arg" constructor.[3]
Visual Basic .NET[edit]
In Visual Basic .NET, constructors use a method declaration with the name "New".


Class Foobar
  Private strData As String

  ' Constructor
  Public Sub New(ByVal someParam As String)
     strData = someParam
  End Sub
End Class



' code somewhere else
' instantiating an object with the above constructor
Dim foo As New Foobar(".NET")

C#[edit]
Example C# constructor:


public class MyClass
{
    private int a;
    private string b;

    // Constructor
    public MyClass() : this(42, "string")
    {
    }

    // Overloading a constructor
    public MyClass(int a, string b)
    {
        this.a = a;
        this.b = b;
    }
}



// Code somewhere
// Instantiating an object with the constructor above
MyClass c = new MyClass(42, "string");

C# static constructor[edit]
In C#, a static constructor is a static data initializer. Static constructors are also called class constructors. Since the actual method generated has the name .cctor they are often also called "cctors".[4][5]
Static constructors allow complex static variable initialization.[6] Static constructors are called implicitly when the class is first accessed. Any call to a class (static or constructor call), triggers the static constructor execution. Static constructors are thread safe and implement a singleton pattern. When used in a generic programming class, static constructors are called at every new generic instantiation one per type. Static variables are instantiated as well.


public class MyClass
{
    private static int _A;

    // Normal constructor
    static MyClass()
    {
        _A = 32;
    }

    // Standard default constructor
    public MyClass()
    {

    }
}



// Code somewhere
// Instantiating an object with the constructor above
// right before the instantiation
// The variable static constructor is executed and _A is 32
MyClass c = new MyClass();

C++[edit]
In C++, the name of the constructor is the name of the class. It returns nothing. It can have parameters like any member function. Constructor functions are usually declared in the public section, but can also be declared in the protected and private sections, if the user wants to restrict access to them.
The constructor has two parts. First is the initializer list which follows the parameter list and before the method body. It starts with a colon and entries are comma-separated. The initializer list is not required, but offers the opportunity to provide values for data members and avoid separate assignment statements. The initializer list is required if you have const or reference type data members, or members that do not have parameterless constructor logic. Assignments occur according to the order in which data members are declared (even if the order in the initializer list is different).[7] The second part is the body, which is a normal method body enclosed in curly brackets.
C++ allows more than one constructor. The other constructors must have different parameters. Additionally constructors which contain parameters which are given default values, must adhere to the restriction that not all parameters are given a default value. This is a situation which only matters if there is a default constructor. The constructor of a base class (or base classes) can also be called by a derived class. Constructor functions are not inherited and their addresses cannot be referenced. When memory allocation is required, the new and delete operators are called implicitly.
A copy constructor has a parameter of the same type passed as const reference, for example Vector(const Vector&amp; rhs). If it is not provided explicitly, the compiler uses the copy constructor for each member variable or simply copies values in case of primitive types. The default implementation is not efficient if the class has dynamically allocated members (or handles to other resources), because it can lead to double calls to delete (or double release of resources) upon destruction.


class Foobar {
public:
    Foobar(double r = 1.0, double alpha = 0.0) // Constructor, parameters with default values.
    : x(r*cos(alpha)) // &lt;- Initializer list
    {
        y = r*sin(alpha); // &lt;- Normal assignment
    }

private:
    double x;
    double y;
};

Example invocations:


Foobar a,
       b(3),
       c(5, M_PI/4);

On returning objects from functions or passing objects by value, the objects copy constructor will be called implicitly, unless return value optimization applies.
C++ implicitly generates a default copy constructor which will call the copy constructors for all base classes and all member variables unless the programmer provides one, explicitly deletes the copy constructor (to prevent cloning) or one of the base classes or member variables copy constructor is deleted or not accessible (private). Most cases calling for a customized copy constructor (e.g. reference counting, deep copy of pointers) also require customizing the destructor and the copy assignment operator. This is commonly referred to as the Rule of three.
F#[edit]
In F#, a constructor can include any let or do statements defined in a class. let statements define private fields and do statements execute code. Additional constructors can be defined using the new keyword.


type MyClass(_a : int, _b : string) = class
    // Primary constructor
    let a = _a
    let b = _b
    do printfn "a = %i, b = %s" a b

    // Additional constructors
    new(_a : int) = MyClass(_a, "") then
        printfn "Integer parameter given"

    new(_b : string) = MyClass(0, _b) then
        printfn "String parameter given"

    new() = MyClass(0, "") then
        printfn "No parameter given"
end



// Code somewhere
// instantiating an object with the primary constructor
let c1 = new MyClass(42, "string")

// instantiating an object with additional constructors
let c2 = new MyClass(42)
let c3 = new MyClass("string")
let c4 = MyClass() // "new" keyword is optional

Eiffel[edit]
In Eiffel, the routines which initialize new objects are called creation procedures. Creation procedures have the following traits:

Creation procedures have no explicit return type (by definition of procedure).[a]
Creation procedures are named.
Creation procedures are designated by name as creation procedures in the text of the class.
Creation procedures can be explicitly invoked to re-initialize existing objects.
Every effective (i.e., concrete or non-abstract) class must designate at least one creation procedure.
Creation procedures must leave the newly initialized object in a state that satisfies the class invariant.[b]

Although object creation involves some subtleties,[8] the creation of an attribute with a typical declaration x: T as expressed in a creation instruction create x.make consists of the following sequence of steps:

Create a new direct instance of type T.[c]
Execute the creation procedure make to the newly created instance.
Attach the newly initialized object to the entity x.

In the first snippet below, class POINT is defined. The procedure make is coded after the keyword feature.
The keyword create introduces a list of procedures which can be used to initialize instances. In this case the list includes default_create, a procedure with an empty implementation inherited from class ANY, and the make procedure coded within the class.


class
    POINT
create
    default_create, make

feature

    make (a_x_value: REAL; a_y_value: REAL)
        do
            x := a_x_value
            y := a_y_value
        end

    x: REAL
            -- X coordinate

    y: REAL
            -- Y coordinate
        ...

In the second snippet, a class which is a client to POINT has a declarations my_point_1 and my_point_2 of type POINT.
In procedural code, my_point_1 is created as the origin (0.0, 0.0). Because no creation procedure is specified, the procedure default_create inherited from class ANY is used. This line could have been coded create my_point_1.default_create . Only procedures named as creation procedures can be used in an instruction with the create keyword. Next is a creation instruction for my_point_2, providing initial values for the my_point_2's coordinates. The third instruction makes an ordinary instance call to the make procedure to reinitialize the instance attached to my_point_2 with different values.


    my_point_1: POINT
    my_point_2: POINT
        ...

            create my_point_1
            create my_point_2.make (3.0, 4.0)
            my_point_2.make (5.0, 8.0)
        ...

CFML[edit]
CFML uses a method named 'init' as a constructor method.
Cheese.cfc


component {
   // properties
   property name="cheeseName";

   // constructor
   function Cheese init( required string cheeseName ) {
      variables.cheeseName = arguments.cheeseName;
      return this;
   }
}

Create instance of a cheese.


myCheese = new Cheese( 'Cheddar' );

Since ColdFusion 10,[9] CFML has also supported specifying the name of the constructor method:


component initmethod="Cheese" {
   // properties
   property name="cheeseName";

   // constructor
   function Cheese Cheese( required string cheeseName ) {
      variables.cheeseName = arguments.cheeseName;
      return this;
   }
}

Object Pascal[edit]
In Object Pascal, the constructor is similar to a factory method. The only syntactic difference to regular methods is the keyword constructor in front of the name (instead of procedure or function). It can have any name, though the convention is to have Create as prefix, such as in CreateWithFormatting. Creating an instance of a class works like calling a static method of a class: TPerson.Create('Peter').


program OopProgram;

type
  TPerson = class
  private
    FName: string;
  public
    property Name: string read FName;
    constructor Create(AName: string);
  end;

constructor TPerson.Create(AName: string);
begin
  FName := AName;
end;

var
  Person: TPerson;
begin
  Person := TPerson.Create('Peter'); // allocates an instance of TPerson and then calls TPerson.Create with the parameter AName = 'Peter'
end.

Perl[edit]
In Perl programming language version 5, by default, constructors are factory methods, that is, methods that create and return the object, concretely meaning create and return a blessed reference. A typical object is a reference to a hash, though rarely references to other types are used too. By convention the only constructor is named new, though it is allowed to name it otherwise, or to have multiple constructors. For example, a Person class may have a constructor named new as well as a constructor new_from_file which reads a file for Person attributes, and new_from_person which uses another Person object as a template.


package Person;
# In Perl constructors are named 'new' by convention.
sub new {
    # Class name is implicitly passed in as 0th argument.
    my $class = shift;

    # Default attribute values, if you have any.
    my %defaults = ( foo =&gt; "bar" );

    # Initialize attributes as a combination of default values and arguments passed.
    my $self = { %defaults, @_ };

    # Check for required arguments, class invariant, etc.
    if ( not defined $self-&gt;{first_name} ) {
        die "Mandatory attribute missing in Person-&gt;new(): first_name";
    }
    if ( not defined $self-&gt;{last_name} ) {
        die "Mandatory attribute missing in Person-&gt;new(): last_name";
    }
    if ( defined $self-&gt;{age} and $self-&gt;{age} &lt; 18 ) {
        die "Invalid attribute value in Person-&gt;new(): age &lt; 18";
    }

    # Perl makes an object belong to a class by 'bless'.
    bless $self, $class;
    return $self;
}
1;

Perl with Moose[edit]
With the Moose object system for Perl, most of this boilerplate can be left out, a default new is created, attributes can be specified, as well as whether they can be set, reset, or are required. In addition, any extra constructor functionality can be included in a BUILD method which the Moose generated constructor will call, after it has checked the arguments. A BUILDARGS method can be specified to handle constructor arguments not in hashref / key =&gt; value form.


package Person;
# enable Moose-style object construction
use Moose;

# first name ( a string) can only be set at construction time ('ro')
has first_name =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro', isa =&gt; 'Str', required =&gt; 1);
# last name ( a string) can only be set at construction time ('ro')
has last_name  =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro', isa =&gt; 'Str', required =&gt; 1);
# age (Integer) can be modified after construction ('rw'), and is not required
# to be passed to be constructor.  Also creates a 'has_age' method which returns
# true if age has been set
has age        =&gt; (is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'Int', predicate =&gt; 'has_age');

# Check custom requirements
sub BUILD {
      my $self = shift;
      if ($self-&gt;has_age &amp;&amp; $self-&gt;age &lt; 18) { # no under 18s
           die "No under-18 Persons";
      }
}
1;

In both cases the Person class is instiated like this:


use Person;
my $p = Person-&gt;new( first_name =&gt; 'Sam', last_name =&gt; 'Ashe', age =&gt; 42 );

PHP[edit]
In PHP version 5 and above, the constructor is a method named __construct() (notice that it's a double underscore), which the keyword new automatically calls after creating the object. It is usually used to automatically perform initializations such as property initializations. Constructors can also accept arguments, in which case, when the new statement is written, you also need to send the constructor arguments for the parameters.[1]


class Person
{
    private $name;

    public function __construct($name)
    {
        $this-&gt;name = $name;
    }

    public function getName()
    {
        return $this-&gt;name;
    }
}

Python[edit]
In Python, constructors are defined by one or both of __new__ and __init__ methods. A new instance is created by calling the class as if it were a function, which calls the __new__ and __init__ methods. If a constructor method is not defined in the class, the next one found in the class's Method Resolution Order will be called.[10]
In the typical case, only the __init__ method need be defined. (The most common exception is for immutable objects.)


class ExampleClass(object):
    def __new__(cls, value):
        print("Creating new instance...")
        # Call the superclass constructor to create the instance.
        instance = super(ExampleClass, cls).__new__(cls)
        return instance
    def __init__(self, value):
        print("Initialising instance...")
        self.payload = value

exampleInstance = ExampleClass(42)
# prints "Creating new instance..." followed by "Initialising instance..."

print(exampleInstance.payload)
# prints 42

Classes normally act as factories for new instances of themselves, that is, a class is a callable object (like a function), with the call being the constructor, and calling the class returns an instance of that class. However the __new__ method is permitted to return something other than an instance of the class for specialised purposes. In that case, the __init__ is not invoked.[11]
Ruby[edit]
In Ruby, constructors are created by defining a method called initialize. This method is executed to initialize each new instance.


class ExampleClass
  def initialize
    puts "Hello there"
  end
end

ExampleClass.new # =&gt; "Hello there"

Notes[edit]


^ Eiffel routines are either procedures or functions. Procedures never have a return type. Functions always have a return type.
^ Because the inherited class invariant must be satisfied, there is no mandatory call to the parents' constructors.
^ The Eiffel standard requires fields to be initialized on first access, so it is not necessary to perform default field initialization during object creation.

Infinity Broadcasting Corporation was a radio company that existed from 1972 until 2005. It was founded by Michael A. Wiener and Gerald Carrus. It became associated with popular radio personalities like Opie and Anthony, Howard Stern, Don Imus and Mike Francesa. Infinity merged with CBS Corporation in 1997 and later became part of Viacom in 2000, when CBS and Viacom merged. After the Viacom split in 2005, Infinity changed its name to CBS Radio.

History[edit]
Formation and pre-merger[edit]
Infinity was founded in 1972 by two former Metromedia executives Michael A. Wiener and Gerald Carrus, with the acquisition of KOME, an FM radio station that served the San Francisco Bay Area, and finally received its license by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) a year later.[1] In 1979, Infinity acquired WBCN in Boston.
In 1981, Mel Karmazin was bought in as new president. Karmazin oversaw the operation of New York's WNEW-AM (now WBBR) and WNEW-FM (now WWFS) for Metromedia. Soon after, the company acquired fellow New York stations WNEW-FM, WKTU (now WBMP; the present-day WKTU is owned by Clear Channel Communications), WZRC, and WFAN the following years, followed by WYSP-FM in Philadelphia. In 1983, Infinity absorbed KXYZ in Houston and WJMK-FM and WJJD in Chicago.
Infinity became a publicly traded company in 1986. Within a year, it had purchased six more stations: KROQ-FM in Los Angeles, WJFK-FM in Washington, D.C., WQYK-AM/FM in Tampa, and KVIL-AM/FM in Dallas.
The company reverted to a private company in the late 1980s,[why?] but it became a public company again in 1992. In 1993, Infinity was expanded to 22 radio stations.[how?][clarification needed][citation needed]
Merger with CBS and Viacom[edit]
As a result of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which loosened ownership restrictions of broadcast stations, Infinity was able to quickly acquire more stations, owning over 75 at the time of the merger with... [clarification needed]
In 1997, it was announced that Westinghouse Electric Corporation (which owned CBS) would acquire Infinity Broadcasting. Karmazin had attempted to acquire CBS, but Michael Jordan, CEO of Westinghouse, refused to sell the firm to Karmazin but instead agreed to buy Infinity. The $4.9 billion deal was completed on December 31, 1996.[2] As a result of the Westinghouse purchase, Infinity was merged into the CBS Radio Group, with Karmazin as president. Karmazin soon became chairman and CEO of CBS Radio, and took the control of the CBS television network.
Shortly after, Westinghouse sold its non-broadcasting assets and renamed itself as CBS Corporation. In 1998, CBS decided to spin off a portion of its radio and outdoor advertising holdings as Infinity Broadcasting Corp., once again bringing the Infinity name back to the public. The stock offering was the largest in the media industry at the time and raised $2.87 billion.
The most significant move during 1999, however, was the deal struck with Viacom in September. Sumner Redstone, CEO of Viacom, shot down Karmazin's offer to buy Viacom. Karmazin then offered CBS to Redstone, who eventually made a $37 billion proposal to merge the two companies together. Viacom completed the CBS Corp. purchase in May 2000, and it retained 80% ownership of Infinity. At that same year, Infinity acquired Outdoor Systems and renamed it Infinity Outdoor.
Under the new ownership by Viacom, Infinity acquired 18 radio stations from its competitor, Clear Channel Communications, which needed to divest them as part of its own merger with AMFM Incorporated. The company also purchased Giraudy SA, an outdoor advertising company based in France. In 2002, Viacom acquired the remaining shares of Infinity that it did not already own, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. At that time, Infinity Outdoor was separated from Infinity Broadcasting and renamed Viacom Outdoor.
Departure of Mel Karmazin and Epilogue[edit]
Karmazin resigned on May 2004, due to many differences with Redstone.[3] Karmazin later said he didn't get along with Redstone and found it difficult to be "No. 2" at a company, but particularly under Redstone. The two executives continued to snipe at each other through the media even a year after Karmazin left Viacom.[4]
On December 14, 2005, Infinity Broadcasting reverted to CBS Radio, and joined with the CBS and UPN networks, Paramount's television properties, Showtime Networks, Viacom Outdoor, Simon &amp; Schuster, and Paramount Parks into a revived CBS Corporation. At that time, CBS Corp. spun off the "new" Viacom, which includes MTV Networks, BET, and Paramount Pictures, among other assets.
Currently, the Infinity Radio name and logo is used for an online-only variety hits station on CBS Radio's streaming platform, Radio.com, presumably to prevent trademark dilution.

			Variadic template
									
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				In computer programming, variadic templates are templates that take a variable number of arguments.
Variadic templates are supported by C++ (since the C++11 standard), and the D programming language.

C++[edit]
The variadic template feature of C++ was designed by Douglas Gregor and Jaakko Järvi [1][2] and was later standardized in C++11. Prior to C++11, templates (classes and functions) could only take a fixed number of arguments, which had to be specified when a template was first declared. C++11 allows template definitions to take an arbitrary number of arguments of any type.


template&lt;typename... Values&gt; class tuple;

The above template class tuple will take any number of typenames as its template parameters. Here, an instance of the above template class is instantiated with three type arguments:


tuple&lt;int, std::vector&lt;int&gt;, std::map&lt;&lt;std::string&gt;, std::vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;&gt; some_instance_name;

The number of arguments can be zero, so tuple&lt;&gt; some_instance_name; will work as well.
If one does not want to have a variadic template that takes 0 arguments, then this definition will work as well:


template&lt;typename First, typename... Rest&gt; class tuple;

Variadic templates may also apply to functions, thus not only providing a type-safe add-on to variadic functions (such as printf) - but also allowing a printf-like function to process non-trivial objects.


template&lt;typename... Params&gt; void printf(const std::string &amp;str_format, Params... parameters);

The ellipsis (...) operator has two roles. When it occurs to the left of the name of a parameter, it declares a parameter pack. Using the parameter pack, the user can bind zero or more arguments to the variadic template parameters. Parameter packs can also be used for non-type parameters. By contrast, when the ellipsis operator occurs to the right of a template or function call argument, it unpacks the parameter packs into separate arguments, like the args... in the body of printf below. In practice, the use of an ellipsis operator in the code causes the whole expression that precedes the ellipsis to be repeated for every subsequent argument unpacked from the argument pack; and all these expressions will be separated by a comma.
The use of variadic templates is often recursive. The variadic parameters themselves are not readily available to the implementation of a function or class. Therefore, the typical mechanism for defining something like a C++11 variadic printf replacement would be as follows:


void printf(const char *s)
{
    while (*s) {
        if (*s == '%') {
            if (*(s + 1) == '%') {
                ++s;
            }
            else {
                throw std::runtime_error("invalid format string: missing arguments");
            }
        }
        std::cout &lt;&lt; *s++;
    }
}

template&lt;typename T, typename... Args&gt;
void printf(const char *s, T value, Args... args)
{
    while (*s) {
        if (*s == '%') {
            if (*(s + 1) == '%') {
                ++s;
            }
            else {
                std::cout &lt;&lt; value;
                s += 2;
                printf(s, args...); // call even when *s == 0 to detect extra arguments
                return;
            }
        }
        std::cout &lt;&lt; *s++;
    }    
}

This is a recursive template. Notice that the variadic template version of printf calls itself, or (in the event that args... is empty) calls the base case.
There is no simple mechanism to iterate over the values of the variadic template. There are few ways to translate the argument pack into single argument use. Usually this will rely on function overloading, or - if the function can simply pick one argument at a time - using a dumb expansion marker:


template&lt;typename... Args&gt; inline void pass(Args&amp;&amp;...) {}

which can be used as follows:


  template&lt;typename... Args&gt; inline void expand(Args&amp;&amp;... args) {
    pass( some_function(args)... );
  }

  expand(42, "answer", true);

which will expand to something like:


  pass( some_function(arg1), some_function(arg2), some_function(arg3) etc... );

The use of this "pass" function is necessary, since the expansion of the argument pack proceeds by separating the function call arguments by commas, which are not equivalent to the comma operator. Therefore, some_function(args)...; will never work. Moreover, this above solution will only work when the return type of some_function is not void. Furthermore, the some_function calls will be executed in an unspecified order, because the order of evaluation of function arguments is undefined. To avoid the unspecified order, brace-enclosed initializer lists can be used, which guarantee strict left-to-right order of evaluation. To avoid the need for a not void return type, the comma operator can be used to always yield 1 in each expansion element.


  struct pass {
    template&lt;typename ...T&gt; pass(T...) {}
  };

  pass{(some_function(args), 1)...};

Instead of executing a function, a lambda expression may be specified and executed in place, which allows executing arbitrary sequences of statements in-place.

   pass{([&amp;]{ std::cout &lt;&lt; args &lt;&lt; std::endl; }(), 1)...};

However, in this particular example, a lambda function is not necessary. A more ordinary expression can be used instead:

   pass{(std::cout &lt;&lt; args &lt;&lt; std::endl, 1)...};

Another way is to use overloading with "termination versions" of functions. This is more universal, but requires a bit more code and more effort to create. One function receives one argument of some type and the argument pack, whereas the other receives neither. (If both have the same list of initial parameters, the call would be ambiguous - a variadic parameter pack alone cannot disambiguate a call.) For example:


void func() {} // termination version

template&lt;typename Arg1, typename... Args&gt;
void func(const Arg1&amp; arg1, const Args&amp;... args)
{
    process( arg1 );
    func(args...); // note: arg1 does not appear here!
}

If args... contains at least one argument, it will redirect to the second version - a parameter pack can be empty, in which case it will simply redirect to the termination version, which will do nothing.
Variadic templates can also be used in an exception specification, a base class list, or the initialization list of a constructor. For example, a class can specify the following:


template &lt;typename... BaseClasses&gt; class ClassName : public BaseClasses... {
public:

    ClassName (BaseClasses&amp;&amp;... base_classes) : BaseClasses(base_classes)... {}
};

The unpack operator will replicate the types for the base classes of ClassName, such that this class will be derived from each of the types passed in. Also, the constructor must take a reference to each base class, so as to initialize the base classes of ClassName.
With regard to function templates, the variadic parameters can be forwarded. When combined with universal references (see above), this allows for perfect forwarding:


template&lt;typename TypeToConstruct&gt; struct SharedPtrAllocator {

    template&lt;typename ...Args&gt; std::shared_ptr&lt;TypeToConstruct&gt; construct_with_shared_ptr(Args&amp;&amp;... params) {
        return std::shared_ptr&lt;TypeToConstruct&gt;(new TypeToConstruct(std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(params)...));
    }
};

This unpacks the argument list into the constructor of TypeToConstruct. The std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(params) syntax is the syntax that perfectly forwards arguments as their proper types, even with regard to rvalue-ness, to the constructor. The unpack operator will propagate the forwarding syntax to each parameter. This particular factory function automatically wraps the allocated memory in a std::shared_ptr for a degree of safety with regard to memory leaks.
Additionally, the number of arguments in a template parameter pack can be determined as follows:


template&lt;typename ...Args&gt; struct SomeStruct {
    static const int size = sizeof...(Args);
};

The expression SomeStruct&lt;Type1, Type2&gt;::size will yield 2, while SomeStruct&lt;&gt;::size will give 0.
D[edit]
Definition[edit]
Definition of variadic templates in D are based on their C++ counterpart:


template VariadicTemplate(Args...) { /* Body */ }

Likewise, any argument can precede the argument list:


template VariadicTemplate(T, string value, alias symbol, Args...) { /* Body */ }

Basic usage[edit]
Variadic arguments are very similar to constant array in their usage. They can be iterated upon, accessed by an index, have a length property, and can be sliced. Operations are interpreted at compile time, which means operands can't be runtime value (such as function parameters).
Anything which is known at compile time can be passed as a variadic arguments. It makes variadic arguments similar to template alias arguments, but more powerful, as they also accept basic types (char, short, int...).
Here is an example that print the string representation of the variadic parameters. StringOf and StringOf2 produce equal results.


static int s_int;

struct Dummy {}

void main() {
  pragma(msg, StringOf!("Hello world", uint, Dummy, 42, s_int));
  pragma(msg, StringOf2!("Hello world", uint, Dummy, 42, s_int));
}

template StringOf(Args...) {
  enum StringOf = Args[0].stringof ~ StringOf!(Args[1..$]);
}

template StringOf() {
  enum StringOf = "";
}

template StringOf2(Args...) {
  static if (Args.length == 0)
    enum StringOf2 = "";
  else
    enum StringOf2 = Args[0].stringof ~ StringOf2!(Args[1..$]);
}

Outputs:


"Hello world"uintDummy42s_int
"Hello world"uintDummy42s_int

TypeTuple[edit]
Variadic template are often used to create a construction called TypeTuple (see std.typetuple). A TypeTuple definition is actually very straightforward:


template TypeTuple(Args...) {
  alias TypeTuple = Args;
}

This structure allows one to manipulate a "list" of variadic arguments that will auto expand. This enables any operation you would expect:


import std.typetuple;

void main() {
  // Note: TypeTuple can't be modified, and an alias can't be rebound, so we'll need to define new names for our modifications.
  alias numbers = TypeTuple!(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6);
  // Slicing
  alias lastHalf = numbers[$ / 2 .. $];
  static assert(lastHalf == TypeTuple!(4, 5, 6));
  // TypeTuple auto expansion (thanks to D eponymous template feature).
  alias digits = TypeTuple!(0, numbers, 7, 8, 9);
  static assert(digits == TypeTuple!(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9));
  // std.typetuple provides templates to work with TypeTuple, such as anySatisfy, allSatisfy, staticMap, and Filter.
  alias evenNumbers = Filter!(isEven, digits);
  static assert(evenNumbers == TypeTuple!(0, 2, 4, 6, 8));
}

template isEven(int number) {
  enum isEven = (0 == (number % 2));
}

General Dynamics Corporation is an American aerospace and defense company formed by mergers and divestitures. It is the world's fifth-largest defense contractor based on 2012 revenues.[4] General Dynamics is headquartered in West Falls Church, Fairfax County, Virginia.[5][6][7]
The company has changed markedly in the post–Cold War era of defense consolidation. It has four main business segments: Marine Systems; Combat Systems; Information Systems and Technology; and Aerospace. General Dynamics' former Fort Worth Division manufactured one of the Western world's most-produced jet fighters, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon -- until 1993, when production was sold to Lockheed. In 1999, the company re-entered the airframe business with its purchase of Gulfstream Aerospace.

History[edit]




Poster by Erik Nitsche from 1960


Electric Boat[edit]
Main article: General Dynamics Electric Boat
General Dynamics traces its ancestry to John Philip Holland's Holland Torpedo Boat Company. This company was responsible for developing the U.S. Navy's first submarines built at Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard, located in Elizabethport, New Jersey. The revolutionary submarine boat Holland VI was built there, its keel being laid down in 1896. Crescent's superintendent and naval architect, Arthur Leopold Busch, supervised the construction of this submarine. After being launched on 17 May 1897, it was eventually purchased by the Navy and renamed USS&#160;Holland&#160;(SS-1). The Holland was officially commissioned on 12 October 1900 and became the United States Navy's first submarine, later known as SS-1. The Navy placed an order for more submarines, which were developed in rapid succession and were assembled at two different locations on both coasts. These submarines were known as the A-Class or Adder Class, and became America's first fleet of underwater craft at the beginning of the 20th century.
Holland grew short on funds, due to the lengthy and expensive process of introducing the world's first practical submarines, and he had to part with his company and sell his interest to financier Isaac Leopold Rice, renaming the new firm as the Electric Boat Company on 7 February 1899. Holland effectively lost control of the company and found himself earning a salary of $90 a week as chief engineer, while the company that he founded was selling submarines for $300,000 each.[citation needed] Holland resigned from the company effective April 1904. Rice became Electric Boat's first President, remaining there from that time until 1915 when he stepped down just prior to his death on 2 November 1915.
Electric Boat gained a reputation for unscrupulous arms dealing in 1904-05, when it sold submarines to Japan's Imperial Japanese Navy and Russia's Imperial Russian Navy, who were then at war.[8] Holland submarines were also sold to the British Royal Navy through the English armaments company Vickers, and to the Dutch to serve in the Royal Netherlands Navy. The new pioneering craft originally developed by the company was now legitimized as genuine naval weapons by the world's most powerful navies.
In the post-World War II wind-down, Electric Boat was cash-flush but lacking in work, with its workforce shrinking from 13,000 to 4,000 by 1946.[citation needed] Hoping to diversify, president and chief executive officer John Jay Hopkins started looking for companies that would fit into Electric Boat's market.
Canadair purchase[edit]
Hopkins quickly found that Canadair, owned by the Canadian government, was suffering from similar post-war malaise and was up for sale. Hopkins bought the company for $10 million in 1946. Even by the Canadian government's calculations, the factory alone was worth more than $22 million,[citation needed] excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts.
When Electric Boat purchased Canadair, its production line and inventory systems were in disorder. Hopkins hired Canadian-born mass-production specialist H. Oliver West to take over the president's role and return Canadair to profitability. Shortly after the takeover, Canadair began delivering its new Canadair North Star (a version of the Douglas DC-4), and was able to deliver aircraft to Trans-Canada Airlines, Canadian Pacific Airlines, and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) well in advance of their contracted delivery times.[citation needed]
As defense spending increased with the onset of the Cold War, Canadair went on to win many Canadian military contracts for the Royal Canadian Air Force, and became a major aerospace company. These included Canadair T-33 trainer, the Canadair Argus long-range maritime reconnaissance and transport aircraft, and the Canadair F-86 Sabre. Between 1950 and 1958, 1,815 Sabres were built. Canadair also produced 200 CF-104 Starfighter supersonic fighter aircraft, a license-built version of the Lockheed F-104.
In 1976, Canadair was sold back to the Canadian Government, which sold it to Bombardier Inc. in 1986.
General Dynamics emerges[edit]
As the aircraft production at Canadair became increasingly important to the company, Hopkins argued that the name "Electric Boat" was no longer appropriate. On 24 April 1952, Electric Boat was reorganized as General Dynamics.[9]
General Dynamics was still flush with cash after the Canadair purchase, and, given the success of that company, it continued to look for new aviation purchases.[citation needed] In March 1953, it purchased Convair from the Atlas Group.[9] The sale was approved by government oversight with the proviso that General Dynamics would continue to operate out of Air Force Plant 4 in Fort Worth, Texas. This factory was set up in order to spread out strategic aircraft production and rented to Convair during the war to produce B-24 Liberator bombers. Over time, the Fort Worth plant became Convair's major production center.[citation needed]
As was the case with Canadair, Convair worked as an independent division under the General Dynamics umbrella. Over the next decade, the company introduced the F-106 Delta Dart Interceptor (the earlier F-102 Delta Dagger being designed before the takeover), the B-58 Hustler, and the Convair 880 and 990 airliners. Convair also introduced the first U.S. operational intercontinental ballistic missile, the Atlas.
Management churn[edit]
Hopkins fell seriously ill during 1957, and was eventually replaced by Frank Pace later that year.[9] Meanwhile, John Naish succeeded Joseph McNarney as president of Convair. Henry Crown became the company's largest shareholder, and merged his Material Service Corporation with GD in 1959.
Naish left in May 1961, taking most of Convair's top people with him. GD subsequently reorganized into Eastern Group in New York and Western Group in San Diego, California, with the latter taking over all of the aerospace activities and dropping the Convair brand name from its aircraft in the process.[citation needed]
Frank Pace retired under pressure in 1962 and Roger Lewis, former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force and Pan American Airways CEO was brought in as the new CEO. The company recovered then fell back into the same struggles. In 1971, the board brought in Dave Lewis (no relation) as Chairman and CEO. At the time he was President of McDonnell Douglas. Dave Lewis served until his retirement in 1985.
Aviation powerhouse[edit]
During the early 1960s the company bid on the United States Air Force's TFX (Tactical Fighter, Experimental) project for a new low-level "penetrator". Robert McNamara, newly installed as the Secretary of Defense, forced a merger of the TFX with U.S. Navy plans for a new long-range "fleet defender" aircraft. In order to bid on a naval version successfully, GD partnered with Grumman, who would build a customized version for aircraft carrier duties. After four rounds of bids and changes, the GD/Grumman team finally won the contract over a Boeing submission.
The F-111 first flew in December 1964. The F-111B flew in May 1965, but the Navy said that it was too heavy for use on aircraft carriers.[citation needed] With an unacceptable Navy version, estimates for 2,400 F-111s, including exports, were sharply reduced, but GD still managed to make a $300-million profit on the project. Grumman went on to build the F-14 Tomcat, an aircraft that used many of the innovations of the F-111, but designed solely as a carrier-borne fighter.
Reorganization[edit]
In May 1965, GD reorganized into 12 operating divisions based on product lines. The board decided to build all future planes in Fort Worth, ending plane production at San Diego (Convair's original plant), but continuing with space and missile development there. In October 1970, Roger Lewis left and David S. Lewis from McDonnell Douglas was named CEO. Lewis required that the company headquarters move to St. Louis, Missouri, which occurred in February 1971.[citation needed]
F-16 success[edit]
In 1972, GD bid on the USAF's Lightweight Fighter (LWF) project. GD and Northrop were awarded prototype contracts. GD's F-111 program was winding down, and the company desperately needed a new aircraft contract. It organized its own "Skunk Works" group, the Advanced Concepts Laboratory, and responded with a new aircraft design incorporating modern equipment.
GD's YF-16 first flew in January 1974, and proved to have slightly better performance than the YF-17 in head-to-head testing. It entered production as the F-16 in January 1975 with an initial order of 650 and a total order of 1,388. The F-16 also won contracts worldwide, beating the F-17 in foreign competition as well. GD built an aircraft production factory in Fort Worth, Texas. F-16 orders eventually totaled more than 4,000, making it the largest and most successful program for GD, and one of the most successful western military projects since World War II.




In 1999 the company acquired Gulfstream Aerospace. Here, a Gulfstream G650 departs Bristol Airport, England in 2014.


Land Systems focus[edit]
In 1976, General Dynamics sold the struggling Canadair back to the Canadian government for $38 million. By 1984, General Dynamics had four divisions: Convair in San Diego, General Dynamics-Fort Worth, General Dynamics-Pomona, and General Dynamics-Electronics. In 1985 a further reorganization created the Space Systems Division from the Convair Space division. In 1985, GD also acquired Cessna. In 1986 the Pomona division (which mainly produced the Standard Missile and the Phalanx CIWS for the Navy) was split up, creating the Valley Systems Division. Valley Systems produced the Stinger surface-to-air missile and the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). Both units were recombined into one entity in 1992.
Henry Crown, still GD's largest shareholder, died on 15 August 1990. Following this, the company started to rapidly divest its under-performing divisions under CEO William Anders. Cessna was re-sold to Textron in January 1992, the San Diego and Pomona missile production units to General Motors-Hughes Aerospace in May 1992, the Fort Worth aircraft production to Lockheed in March 1993 (a nearby electronics production facility was separately sold to Israeli-based Elbit Systems, marking that company's entry into the United States market), and its Space Systems Division to Martin Marietta in 1994. The remaining Convair Aircraft Structure unit was sold to McDonnell Douglas in 1994. The remains of the Convair Division were simply closed in 1996. GD's exit from the aviation world was short-lived, and in 1999 the company acquired Gulfstream Aerospace. The Pomona operation was closed shortly after its sale to Hughes Aircraft.
Having divested itself of its aviation holdings, GD concentrated on land and sea products. GD purchased Chrysler's defense divisions in 1982, renaming them General Dynamics Land Systems. In 2003 it purchased the defense divisions of General Motors as well. It is now a major supplier of armored vehicles of all types, including the M1 Abrams, LAV 25, Stryker, and a wide variety of vehicles based on these chassis.
General Dynamics Land Systems was hurt by the cancellation of the US Army's Future Combat Systems program and the loss in the MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle competition.[citation needed]
Government lawsuit and settlement[edit]
On August 19, 2008, GD agreed to pay $4 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the US Government claiming that a GD unit fraudulently billed the government for defectively manufactured parts used in US military aircraft and submarines. The US alleged that GD defectively manufactured or failed to test parts used in US military aircraft from September 2001 to August 2003, such as the C-141 Starlifter transport plane. The GD unit involved, based in Glen Cove, New York, closed in 2004.[10]

Financials[edit]
General Dynamics has about $30 billion in sales, primarily military, but also civilian with its Gulfstream Aerospace unit and conventional shipbuilding and repair with its National Steel and Shipbuilding subsidiary.
In 2004 General Dynamics bid for the UK company Alvis plc, the leading British manufacturer of armored vehicles. In March the board of Alvis Vickers voted in favor of the £309m takeover. However at the last minute BAE Systems offered £355m for the company in what was seen as a move to keep General Dynamics out of its "back yard".[citation needed] This deal was finalized in June 2004.
General Dynamics has tried to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding but been blocked by regulators and competitors, as this would make General Dynamics the sole manufacturer of nuclear-powered ships in the United States.[citation needed]
Controlled subsidiaries of the corporation are donors to the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute.[35]

Sonar (originally an acronym for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the name "sonar": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of "targets" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.

History
Although some animals (dolphins and bats) have used sound for communication and object detection for millions of years, use by humans in the water is initially recorded by Leonardo da Vinci in 1490: a tube inserted into the water was said to be used to detect vessels by placing an ear to the tube.[1]
In the 19th century an underwater bell was used as an ancillary to lighthouses to provide warning of hazards.
The use of sound to 'echo locate' underwater in the same way as bats use sound for aerial navigation seems to have been prompted by the Titanic disaster of 1912. The world's first patent for an underwater echo ranging device was filed at the British Patent Office by English meteorologist Lewis Richardson a month after the sinking of the Titanic,[2] and a German physicist Alexander Behm obtained a patent for an echo sounder in 1913.
The Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden, while working for the Submarine Signal Company in Boston, built an experimental system beginning in 1912, a system later tested in Boston Harbor, and finally in 1914 from the U.S. Revenue (now Coast Guard) Cutter Miami on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland Canada.[2][3] In that test, Fessenden demonstrated depth sounding, underwater communications (Morse code) and echo ranging (detecting an iceberg at two miles (3&#160;km) range).[4][5] The so-called Fessenden oscillator, at ca. 500&#160;Hz frequency, was unable to determine the bearing of the berg due to the 3 metre wavelength and the small dimension of the transducer's radiating face (less than 1 metre in diameter). The ten Montreal-built British H class submarines launched in 1915 were equipped with a Fessenden oscillator.[6]
During World War I the need to detect submarines prompted more research into the use of sound. The British made early use of underwater listening devices called hydrophones, while the French physicist Paul Langevin, working with a Russian immigrant electrical engineer, Constantin Chilowsky, worked on the development of active sound devices for detecting submarines in 1915. Although piezoelectric and magnetostrictive transducers later superseded the electrostatic transducers they used, this work influenced future designs. Lightweight sound-sensitive plastic film and fibre optics have been used for hydrophones (acousto-electric transducers for in-water use), while Terfenol-D and PMN (lead magnesium niobate) have been developed for projectors.
ASDIC

In 1916, under the British Board of Invention and Research, Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle took on the active sound detection project with A B Wood, producing a prototype for testing in mid-1917. This work, for the Anti-Submarine Division of the British Naval Staff, was undertaken in utmost secrecy, and used quartz piezoelectric crystals to produce the world's first practical underwater active sound detection apparatus. To maintain secrecy no mention of sound experimentation or quartz was made - the word used to describe the early work ('supersonics') was changed to 'ASD'ics, and the quartz material to 'ASD'ivite: "ASD" for "Anti-Submarine Division", hence the British acronym ASDIC. In 1939, in response to a question from the Oxford English Dictionary, the Admiralty made up the story that it stood for 'Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee', and this is still widely believed,[7] though no committee bearing this name has been found in the Admiralty archives.[8]
By 1918, both France and Britain had built prototype active systems. The British tested their ASDIC on HMS&#160;Antrim in 1920, and started production in 1922. The 6th Destroyer Flotilla had ASDIC-equipped vessels in 1923. An anti-submarine school, HMS Osprey, and a training flotilla of four vessels were established on Portland in 1924. The US Sonar QB set arrived in 1931.
By the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Navy had five sets for different surface ship classes, and others for submarines, incorporated into a complete anti-submarine attack system. The effectiveness of early ASDIC was hamstrung by the use of the depth charge as an anti-submarine weapon. This required an attacking vessel to pass over a submerged contact before dropping charges over the stern, resulting in a loss of ASDIC contact in the moments leading up to attack. The hunter was effectively firing blind, during which time a submarine commander could take evasive action. This situation was remedied by using several ships cooperating and by the adoption of "ahead throwing weapons", such as Hedgehog and later Squid, which projected warheads at a target ahead of the attacker and thus still in ASDIC contact. Developments during the war resulted in British ASDIC sets which used several different shapes of beam, continuously covering blind spots. Later, acoustic torpedoes were used.
At the start of World War II, British ASDIC technology was transferred for free to the United States. Research on ASDIC and underwater sound was expanded in the UK and in the US. Many new types of military sound detection were developed. These included sonobuoys, first developed by the British in 1944 under the codename High Tea, dipping/dunking sonar and mine detection sonar. This work formed the basis for post war developments related to countering the nuclear submarine. Work on sonar had also been carried out in the Axis countries, notably in Germany, which included countermeasures. At the end of World War II this German work was assimilated by Britain and the US. Sonars have continued to be developed by many countries, including Russia, for both military and civil uses. In recent years the major military development has been the increasing interest in low frequency active systems.
SONAR
During the 1930s American engineers developed their own underwater sound detection technology and important discoveries were made, such as thermoclines, that would help future development.[9] After technical information was exchanged between the two countries during the Second World War, Americans began to use the term SONAR for their systems, coined as the equivalent of the British-invented RADAR.
Materials and designs
There was little progress in development from 1915 to 1940. In 1940, the US sonars typically consisted of a magnetostrictive transducer and an array of nickel tubes connected to a 1-foot-diameter steel plate attached back to back to a Rochelle salt crystal in a spherical housing. This assembly penetrated the ship hull and was manually rotated to the desired angle. The piezoelectric Rochelle salt crystal had better parameters, but the magnetostrictive unit was much more reliable. Early WW2 losses prompted rapid research in the field, pursuing both improvements in magnetostrictive transducer parameters and Rochelle salt reliability. Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP), a superior alternative, was found as a replacement for Rochelle salt; the first application was a replacement of the 24&#160;kHz Rochelle salt transducers. Within nine months, Rochelle salt was obsolete. The ADP manufacturing facility grew from few dozen personnel in early 1940 to several thousands in 1942.
One of the earliest application of ADP crystals were hydrophones for acoustic mines; the crystals were specified for low frequency cutoff at 5&#160;Hz, withstanding mechanical shock for deployment from aircraft from 10,000&#160;ft, and ability to survive neighbouring mine explosions. One of key features of ADP reliability is its zero aging characteristics; the crystal keeps its parameters even over prolonged storage.
Another application was for acoustic homing torpedoes. Two pairs of directional hydrophones were mounted on the torpedo nose, in the horizontal and vertical plane; the difference signals from the pairs were used to steer the torpedo left-right and up-down. A countermeasure was developed: the targeted submarine discharged an effervescent chemical, and the torpedo went after the noisier fizzy decoy. The counter-countermeasure was a torpedo with active sonar – a transducer was added to the torpedo nose, and the microphones were listening for its reflected periodic tone bursts. The transducers comprised identical rectangular crystal plates arranged to diamond-shaped areas in staggered rows.
Passive sonar arrays for submarines were developed from ADP crystals. Several crystal assemblies were arranged in a steel tube, vacuum-filled with castor oil, and sealed. The tubes then were mounted in parallel arrays.
The standard US Navy scanning sonar at the end of the World War II operated at 18&#160;kHz, using an array of ADP crystals. Desired longer range however required use of lower frequencies. The required dimensions were too big for ADP crystals, so in the early 1950s magnetostrictive and barium titanate piezoelectric systems were developed, but these had problems achieving uniform impedance characteristics and the beam pattern suffered. Barium titanate was then replaced with more stable lead zirconate titanate (PZT), and the frequency was lowered to 5&#160;kHz. The US fleet used this material in the AN/SQS-23 sonar for several decades. The SQS-23 sonar first used magnetostrictive nickel transducers, but these weighed several tons and nickel was expensive and considered a critical material; piezoelectric transducers were therefore substituted. The sonar was a large array of 432 individual transducers. At first the transducers were unreliable, showing mechanical and electrical failures and deteriorating soon after installation; they were also produced by several vendors, had different designs, and their characteristics were different enough to impair the array's performance. The policy to allow repair of individual transducers was then sacrificed, and "expendable modular design", sealed non-repairable modules, was chosen instead, eliminating the problem with seals and other extraneous mechanical parts.[10]
The Imperial Japanese Navy at the onset of WW2 used projectors based on quartz. These were big and heavy, especially if designed for lower frequencies; the one for Type 91 set, operating at 9&#160;kHz, had a diameter of 30&#160;inches and was driven by an oscillator with 5&#160;kW power and 7&#160;kV of output amplitude. The Type 93 projectors consisted of solid sandwiches of quartz, assembled into spherical cast iron bodies. The Type 93 sonars were later replaced with Type 3, which followed German design and used magnetostrictive projectors; the projectors consisted of two rectangular identical independent units in a cast iron rectangular body about 16×9 inches. The exposed area was half the wavelength wide and three wavelengths high. The magnetostrictive cores were made from 4&#160;mm stampings of nickel, and later of an iron-aluminium alloy with aluminium content between 12.7 and 12.9%. The power was provided from a 2&#160;kW at 3.8&#160;kV, with polarization from a 20&#160;V/8&#160;A DC source.
The passive hydrophones of the Imperial Japanese Navy were based on moving coil design, Rochelle salt piezo transducers, and carbon microphones.[11]
Magnetostrictive transducers were pursued after WW2 as an alternative to piezoelectric ones. Nickel scroll-wound ring transducers were used for high-power low-frequency operations, with size up to 13&#160;feet in diameter, probably the largest individual sonar transducers ever. The advantage of metals is their high tensile strength and low input electrical impedance, but they have electrical losses and lower coupling coefficient than PZT, whose tensile strength can be increased by prestressing. Other materials were also tried; nonmetallic ferrites were promising for their low electrical conductivity resulting in low eddy current losses, Metglas offered high coupling coefficient, but they were inferior to PZT overall. In the 1970s, compounds of rare earths and iron were discovered with superior magnetomechanic properties, namely the Terfenol-D alloy. This made possible new designs, e.g. a hybrid magnetostrictive-piezoelectric transducer. The most recent sch material is Galfenol.
Other types of transducers include variable reluctance (or moving armature, or electromagnetic) transducers, where magnetic force acts on the surfaces of gaps, and moving coil (or electrodynamic) transducers, similar to conventional speakers; the latter are used in underwater sound calibration, due to their very low resonance frequencies and flat broadband characteristics above them.[12]

Principle of an active sonar


Active sonar uses a sound transmitter and a receiver. When the two are in the same place it is monostatic operation. When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation. When more transmitters (or more receivers) are used, again spatially separated, it is multistatic operation. Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception. Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically.
Active sonar creates a pulse of sound, often called a "ping", and then listens for reflections (echo) of the pulse. This pulse of sound is generally created electronically using a sonar projector consisting of a signal generator, power amplifier and electro-acoustic transducer/array. A beamformer is usually employed to concentrate the acoustic power into a beam, which may be swept to cover the required search angles. Generally, the electro-acoustic transducers are of the Tonpilz type and their design may be optimised to achieve maximum efficiency over the widest bandwidth, in order to optimise performance of the overall system. Occasionally, the acoustic pulse may be created by other means, e.g. (1) chemically using explosives, or (2) airguns or (3) plasma sound sources.
To measure the distance to an object, the time from transmission of a pulse to reception is measured and converted into a range by knowing the speed of sound. To measure the bearing, several hydrophones are used, and the set measures the relative arrival time to each, or with an array of hydrophones, by measuring the relative amplitude in beams formed through a process called beamforming. Use of an array reduces the spatial response so that to provide wide cover multibeam systems are used. The target signal (if present) together with noise is then passed through various forms of signal processing, which for simple sonars may be just energy measurement. It is then presented to some form of decision device that calls the output either the required signal or noise. This decision device may be an operator with headphones or a display, or in more sophisticated sonars this function may be carried out by software. Further processes may be carried out to classify the target and localise it, as well as measuring its velocity.
The pulse may be at constant frequency or a chirp of changing frequency (to allow pulse compression on reception). Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement, while more complex ones generally include the latter technique. Since digital processing became available pulse compression has usually been implemented using digital correlation techniques. Military sonars often have multiple beams to provide all-round cover while simple ones only cover a narrow arc, although the beam may be rotated, relatively slowly, by mechanical scanning.
Particularly when single frequency transmissions are used, the Doppler effect can be used to measure the radial speed of a target. The difference in frequency between the transmitted and received signal is measured and converted into a velocity. Since Doppler shifts can be introduced by either receiver or target motion, allowance has to be made for the radial speed of the searching platform.
One useful small sonar is similar in appearance to a waterproof flashlight. The head is pointed into the water, a button is pressed, and the device displays the distance to the target. Another variant is a "fishfinder" that shows a small display with shoals of fish. Some civilian sonars (which are not designed for stealth) approach active military sonars in capability, with quite exotic three-dimensional displays of the area near the boat.
When active sonar is used to measure the distance from the transducer to the bottom, it is known as echo sounding. Similar methods may be used looking upward for wave measurement.
Active sonar is also used to measure distance through water between two sonar transducers or a combination of a hydrophone (underwater acoustic microphone) and projector (underwater acoustic speaker). A transducer is a device that can transmit and receive acoustic signals ("pings"). When a hydrophone/transducer receives a specific interrogation signal it responds by transmitting a specific reply signal. To measure distance, one transducer/projector transmits an interrogation signal and measures the time between this transmission and the receipt of the other transducer/hydrophone reply. The time difference, scaled by the speed of sound through water and divided by two, is the distance between the two platforms. This technique, when used with multiple transducers/hydrophones/projectors, can calculate the relative positions of static and moving objects in water.
In combat situations, an active pulse can be detected by an opponent and will reveal a submarine's position.
A very directional, but low-efficiency, type of sonar (used by fisheries, military, and for port security) makes use of a complex nonlinear feature of water known as non-linear sonar, the virtual transducer being known as a parametric array.

Project Artemis
Project Artemis was a one-of-a-kind low-frequency sonar for surveillance that was deployed off Bermuda for several years in the early 1960s. The active portion was deployed from a World War II tanker, and the receiving array was a built into a fixed position on an offshore bank.
Transponder
This is an active sonar device that receives a stimulus and immediately (or with a delay) retransmits the received signal or a predetermined one.
Performance prediction
A sonar target is small relative to the sphere, centred around the emitter, on which it is located. Therefore, the power of the reflected signal is very low, several orders of magnitude less than the original signal. Even if the reflected signal was of the same power, the following example (using hypothetical values) shows the problem: Suppose a sonar system is capable of emitting a 10,000 W/m² signal at 1 m, and detecting a 0.001 W/m² signal. At 100 m the signal will be 1 W/m² (due to the inverse-square law). If the entire signal is reflected from a 10 m² target, it will be at 0.001 W/m² when it reaches the emitter, i.e. just detectable. However, the original signal will remain above 0.001 W/m² until 300 m. Any 10 m² target between 100 and 300 m using a similar or better system would be able to detect the pulse but would not be detected by the emitter. The detectors must be very sensitive to pick up the echoes. Since the original signal is much more powerful, it can be detected many times further than twice the range of the sonar (as in the example).
In active sonar there are two performance limitations, due to noise and reverberation. In general one or other of these will dominate so that the two effects can be initially considered separately.
In noise limited conditions at initial detection:







SL − 2TL + TS − (NL − DI) = DT







where SL is the source level, TL is the transmission loss (or propagation loss), TS is the target strength, NL is the noise level, DI is the directivity index of the array (an approximation to the array gain) and DT is the detection threshold.
In reverberation limited conditions at initial detection (neglecting array gain):







SL − 2TL + TS = RL + DT







where RL is the reverberation level and the other factors are as before.
Hand-held sonar for use by a diver

The LIMIS (= Limpet Mine Imaging Sonar) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar for use by a diver. Its name is because it was designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or Clearance Divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water.ities
The LUIS (= Lensing Underwater Imaging System) is another imaging sonar for use by a diver.
There is or was a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers, that merely displays range.

Passive sonar listens without transmitting. It is often employed in military settings, although it is also used in science applications, e.g., detecting fish for presence/absence studies in various aquatic environments - see also passive acoustics and passive radar. In the very broadest usage, this term can encompass virtually any analytical technique involving remotely generated sound, though it is usually restricted to techniques applied in an aquatic environment.
Identifying sound sources
Passive sonar has a wide variety of techniques for identifying the source of a detected sound. For example, U.S. vessels usually operate 60 Hz alternating current power systems. If transformers or generators are mounted without proper vibration insulation from the hull or become flooded, the 60&#160;Hz sound from the windings can be emitted from the submarine or ship. This can help to identify its nationality, as all European submarines and nearly every other nation's submarine have 50&#160;Hz power systems. Intermittent sound sources (such as a wrench being dropped) may also be detectable to passive sonar. Until fairly recently,[when?] an experienced, trained operator identified signals, but now computers may do this.
Passive sonar systems may have large sonic databases, but the sonar operator usually finally classifies the signals manually. A computer system frequently uses these databases to identify classes of ships, actions (i.e. the speed of a ship, or the type of weapon released), and even particular ships. Publications for classification of sounds are provided by and continually updated by the US Office of Naval Intelligence.
Noise limitations
Passive sonar on vehicles is usually severely limited because of noise generated by the vehicle. For this reason, many submarines operate nuclear reactors that can be cooled without pumps, using silent convection, or fuel cells or batteries, which can also run silently. Vehicles' propellers are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise. High-speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water, and this cavitation has a distinct sound.
The sonar hydrophones may be towed behind the ship or submarine in order to reduce the effect of noise generated by the watercraft itself. Towed units also combat the thermocline, as the unit may be towed above or below the thermocline.
The display of most passive sonars used to be a two-dimensional waterfall display. The horizontal direction of the display is bearing. The vertical is frequency, or sometimes time. Another display technique is to color-code frequency-time information for bearing. More recent displays are generated by the computers, and mimic radar-type plan position indicator displays.
Performance prediction
Unlike active sonar, only one way propagation is involved. Because of the different signal processing used, the minimum detectable signal to noise ratio will be different. The equation for determining the performance of a passive sonar is:





SL − TL = NL − DI + DT





where SL is the source level, TL is the transmission loss, NL is the noise level, DI is the directivity index of the array (an approximation to the array gain) and DT is the detection threshold. The figure of merit of a passive sonar is:





FOM = SL + DI − (NL + DT).





Performance factors
The detection, classification and localisation performance of a sonar depends on the environment and the receiving equipment, as well as the transmitting equipment in an active sonar or the target radiated noise in a passive sonar.
Sound propagation
Sonar operation is affected by variations in sound speed, particularly in the vertical plane. Sound travels more slowly in fresh water than in sea water, though the difference is small. The speed is determined by the water's bulk modulus and mass density. The bulk modulus is affected by temperature, dissolved impurities (usually salinity), and pressure. The density effect is small. The speed of sound (in feet per second) is approximately:

4388 + (11.25 × temperature (in °F)) + (0.0182 × depth (in feet)) + salinity (in parts-per-thousand ).

This empirically derived approximation equation is reasonably accurate for normal temperatures, concentrations of salinity and the range of most ocean depths. Ocean temperature varies with depth, but at between 30 and 100 meters there is often a marked change, called the thermocline, dividing the warmer surface water from the cold, still waters that make up the rest of the ocean. This can frustrate sonar, because a sound originating on one side of the thermocline tends to be bent, or refracted, through the thermocline. The thermocline may be present in shallower coastal waters. However, wave action will often mix the water column and eliminate the thermocline. Water pressure also affects sound propagation: higher pressure increases the sound speed, which causes the sound waves to refract away from the area of higher sound speed. The mathematical model of refraction is called Snell's law.
If the sound source is deep and the conditions are right, propagation may occur in the 'deep sound channel'. This provides extremely low propagation loss to a receiver in the channel. This is because of sound trapping in the channel with no losses at the boundaries. Similar propagation can occur in the 'surface duct' under suitable conditions. However, in this case there are reflection losses at the surface.
In shallow water propagation is generally by repeated reflection at the surface and bottom, where considerable losses can occur.
Sound propagation is affected by absorption in the water itself as well as at the surface and bottom. This absorption depends upon frequency, with several different mechanisms in sea water. Long-range sonar uses low frequencies to minimise absorption effects.
The sea contains many sources of noise that interfere with the desired target echo or signature. The main noise sources are waves and shipping. The motion of the receiver through the water can also cause speed-dependent low frequency noise.
Scattering
When active sonar is used, scattering occurs from small objects in the sea as well as from the bottom and surface. This can be a major source of interference. This acoustic scattering is analogous to the scattering of the light from a car's headlights in fog: a high-intensity pencil beam will penetrate the fog to some extent, but broader-beam headlights emit much light in unwanted directions, much of which is scattered back to the observer, overwhelming that reflected from the target ("white-out"). For analogous reasons active sonar needs to transmit in a narrow beam to minimise scattering.
Target characteristics
The sound reflection characteristics of the target of an active sonar, such as a submarine, are known as its target strength. A complication is that echoes are also obtained from other objects in the sea such as whales, wakes, schools of fish and rocks.
Passive sonar detects the target's radiated noise characteristics. The radiated spectrum comprises a continuous spectrum of noise with peaks at certain frequencies which can be used for classification.
Countermeasures
Active (powered) countermeasures may be launched by a submarine under attack to raise the noise level, provide a large false target, and obscure the signature of the submarine itself.
Passive (i.e., non-powered) countermeasures include:

Mounting noise-generating devices on isolating devices.
Sound-absorbent coatings on the hulls of submarines, for example anechoic tiles.

Military applications
Modern naval warfare makes extensive use of both passive and active sonar from water-borne vessels, aircraft and fixed installations. Although active sonar was used by surface craft in World War II, submarines avoided the use of active sonar due to the potential for revealing their presence and position to enemy forces. However, the advent of modern signal-processing enabled the use of passive sonar as a primary means for search and detection operations. In 1987 a division of Japanese company Toshiba reportedly sold machinery to the Soviet Union that allowed their submarine propeller blades to be milled so that they became radically quieter, making the newer generation of submarines more difficult to detect.
The use of active sonar by a submarine to determine bearing is extremely rare and will not necessarily give high quality bearing or range information to the submarines fire control team. However, use of active sonar on surface ships is very common and is used by submarines when the tactical situation dictates it is more important to determine the position of a hostile submarine than conceal their own position. With surface ships, it might be assumed that the threat is already tracking the ship with satellite data as any vessel around the emitting sonar will detect the emission. Having heard the signal, it is easy to identify the sonar equipment used (usually with its frequency) and its position (with the sound wave's energy). Active sonar is similar to radar in that, while it allows detection of targets at a certain range, it also enables the emitter to be detected at a far greater range, which is undesirable.
Since active sonar reveals the presence and position of the operator, and does not allow exact classification of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods to minimize the risk of detection. Consequently, active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.
Passive sonar has several advantages, most importantly that it is silent. If the target radiated noise level is high enough, it can have a greater range than active sonar, and allows the target to be identified. Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may in principle be detected, depending on the level of noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area, as well as the technology used. To simplify, passive sonar "sees" around the ship using it. On a submarine, nose-mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270°, centered on the ship's alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160° on each side, and the towed array of a full 360°. The invisible areas are due to the ship's own interference. Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis). This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific sound, it is straightforward to identify the object. Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as acoustic intelligence or ACINT.
Another use of passive sonar is to determine the target's trajectory. This process is called Target Motion Analysis (TMA), and the resultant "solution" is the target's range, course, and speed. TMA is done by marking from which direction the sound comes at different times, and comparing the motion with that of the operator's own ship. Changes in relative motion are analyzed using standard geometrical techniques along with some assumptions about limiting cases.
Passive sonar is stealthy and very useful. However, it requires high-tech electronic components and is costly. It is generally deployed on expensive ships in the form of arrays to enhance detection. Surface ships use it to good effect; it is even better used by submarines, and it is also used by airplanes and helicopters, mostly to a "surprise effect", since submarines can hide under thermal layers. If a submarine's commander believes he is alone, he may bring his boat closer to the surface and be easier to detect, or go deeper and faster, and thus make more sound.
Examples of sonar applications in military use are given below. Many of the civil uses given in the following section may also be applicable to naval use.
Anti-submarine warfare




Variable Depth Sonar and its winch


Until recently, ship sonars were usually with hull mounted arrays, either amidships or at the bow. It was soon found after their initial use that a means of reducing flow noise was required. The first were made of canvas on a framework, then steel ones were used. Now domes are usually made of reinforced plastic or pressurized rubber. Such sonars are primarily active in operation. An example of a conventional hull mounted sonar is the SQS-56.
Because of the problems of ship noise, towed sonars are also used. These also have the advantage of being able to be placed deeper in the water. However, there are limitations on their use in shallow water. These are called towed arrays (linear) or variable depth sonars (VDS) with 2/3D arrays. A problem is that the winches required to deploy/recover these are large and expensive. VDS sets are primarily active in operation while towed arrays are passive.
An example of a modern active/passive ship towed sonar is Sonar 2087 made by Thales Underwater Systems.
Torpedoes
Modern torpedoes are generally fitted with an active/passive sonar. This may be used to home directly on the target, but wake following torpedoes are also used. An early example of an acoustic homer was the Mark 37 torpedo.
Torpedo countermeasures can be towed or free. An early example was the German Sieglinde device while the Bold was a chemical device. A widely used US device was the towed AN/SLQ-25 Nixie while Mobile submarine simulator (MOSS) was a free device. A modern alternative to the Nixie system is the UK Royal Navy S2170 Surface Ship Torpedo Defence system.
Mines
Mines may be fitted with a sonar to detect, localize and recognize the required target. Further information is given in acoustic mine and an example is the CAPTOR mine.
Mine countermeasures
Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Sonar, sometimes called "Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar (MOAS)", is a specialized type of sonar used for detecting small objects. Most MCM sonars are hull mounted but a few types are VDS design. An example of a hull mounted MCM sonar is the Type 2193 while the SQQ-32 Mine-hunting sonar and Type 2093 systems are VDS designs. See also Minesweeper (ship)
Submarine navigation
Main article: Submarine navigation
Submarines rely on sonar to a greater extent than surface ships as they cannot use radar at depth. The sonar arrays may be hull mounted or towed. Information fitted on typical fits is given in Oyashio class submarine and Swiftsure class submarine.
Aircraft
Helicopters can be used for antisubmarine warfare by deploying fields of active/passive sonobuoys or can operate dipping sonar, such as the AQS-13. Fixed wing aircraft can also deploy sonobuoys and have greater endurance and capacity to deploy them. Processing from the sonobuoys or Dipping Sonar can be on the aircraft or on ship. Dipping sonar has the advantage of being deployable to depths appropriate to daily conditions Helicopters have also been used for mine countermeasure missions using towed sonars such as the AQS-20A.

Underwater communications
Dedicated sonars can be fitted to ships and submarines for underwater communication. See also the section on the underwater acoustics page.
Ocean surveillance
For many years, the United States operated a large set of passive sonar arrays at various points in the world's oceans, collectively called Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) and later Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS). A similar system is believed to have been operated by the Soviet Union. As permanently mounted arrays in the deep ocean were utilised, they were in very quiet conditions so long ranges could be achieved. Signal processing was carried out using powerful computers ashore. With the ending of the Cold War a SOSUS array has been turned over to scientific use.
In the United States Navy, a special badge known as the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System Badge is awarded to those who have been trained and qualified in its operation.
Underwater security
Sonar can be used to detect frogmen and other scuba divers. This can be applicable around ships or at entrances to ports. Active sonar can also be used as a deterrent and/or disablement mechanism. One such device is the Cerberus system.
See Underwater Port Security System and Anti-frogman techniques#Ultrasound detection.
Hand-held sonar
Limpet Mine Imaging Sonar (LIMIS) is a hand-held or ROV-mounted imaging sonar designed for patrol divers (combat frogmen or clearance divers) to look for limpet mines in low visibility water.
The LUIS is another imaging sonar for use by a diver.
Integrated Navigation Sonar System (INSS) is a small flashlight-shaped handheld sonar for divers that displays range.[13][14]
Intercept sonar
This is a sonar designed to detect and locate the transmissions from hostile active sonars. An example of this is the Type 2082 fitted on the British Vanguard class submarines.
Civilian applications
Fisheries
Fishing is an important industry that is seeing growing demand, but world catch tonnage is falling as a result of serious resource problems. The industry faces a future of continuing worldwide consolidation until a point of sustainability can be reached. However, the consolidation of the fishing fleets are driving increased demands for sophisticated fish finding electronics such as sensors, sounders and sonars. Historically, fishermen have used many different techniques to find and harvest fish. However, acoustic technology has been one of the most important driving forces behind the development of the modern commercial fisheries.
Sound waves travel differently through fish than through water because a fish's air-filled swim bladder has a different density than seawater. This density difference allows the detection of schools of fish by using reflected sound. Acoustic technology is especially well suited for underwater applications since sound travels farther and faster underwater than in air. Today, commercial fishing vessels rely almost completely on acoustic sonar and sounders to detect fish. Fishermen also use active sonar and echo sounder technology to determine water depth, bottom contour, and bottom composition.

Companies such as eSonar, Raymarine UK, Marport Canada, Wesmar, Furuno, Krupp, and Simrad make a variety of sonar and acoustic instruments for the deep sea commercial fishing industry. For example, net sensors take various underwater measurements and transmit the information back to a receiver on board a vessel. Each sensor is equipped with one or more acoustic transducers depending on its specific function. Data is transmitted from the sensors using wireless acoustic telemetry and is received by a hull mounted hydrophone. The analog signals are decoded and converted by a digital acoustic receiver into data which is transmitted to a bridge computer for graphical display on a high resolution monitor.
Echo sounding
Main article: Echo sounding
Echo sounding is a process used to determine the depth of water beneath ships and boats. A type of active sonar, echo sounding is the transmission of an acoustic pulse directly downwards to the seabed, measuring the time between transmission and echo return, after having hit the bottom and bouncing back to its ship of origin. The acoustic pulse is emitted by a transducer which receives the return echo as well. The depth measurement is calculated by multiplying the speed of sound in water(averaging 1,500 meters per second) by the time between emission and echo return.[15][16]
The value of underwater acoustics to the fishing industry has led to the development of other acoustic instruments that operate in a similar fashion to echo-sounders but, because their function is slightly different from the initial model of the echo-sounder, have been given different terms.
Net location
The net sounder is an echo sounder with a transducer mounted on the headline of the net rather than on the bottom of the vessel. Nevertheless, to accommodate the distance from the transducer to the display unit, which is much greater than in a normal echo-sounder, several refinements have to be made. Two main types are available. The first is the cable type in which the signals are sent along a cable. In this case there has to be the provision of a cable drum on which to haul, shoot and stow the cable during the different phases of the operation. The second type is the cable less net-sounder – such as Marport’s Trawl Explorer - in which the signals are sent acoustically between the net and hull mounted receiver/hydrophone on the vessel. In this case no cable drum is required but sophisticated electronics are needed at the transducer and receiver.
The display on a net sounder shows the distance of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, catch sensor transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these catch sensor transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.
Modern versions of the net sounder, using multiple element transducers, function more like a sonar than an echo sounder and show slices of the area in front of the net and not merely the vertical view that the initial net sounders used.
The sonar is an echo-sounder with a directional capability that can show fish or other objects around the vessel.
ROV and UUV
Small sonars have been fitted to Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) to allow their operation in murky conditions. These sonars are used for looking ahead of the vehicle. The Long-Term Mine Reconnaissance System is an UUV for MCM purposes.
Vehicle location
Sonars which act as beacons are fitted to aircraft to allow their location in the event of a crash in the sea. Short and Long Baseline sonars may be used for caring out the location, such as LBL.
Prosthesis for the visually impaired
In 2013 an inventor in the United States unveiled a "spider-sense" bodysuit, equipped with ultrasonic sensors and haptic feedback systems, which alerts the wearer of incoming threats; allowing them to respond to attackers even when blindfolded.[17]
Scientific applications
Biomass estimation
Main article: Bioacoustics
Detection of fish, and other marine and aquatic life, and estimation their individual sizes or total biomass using active sonar techniques. As the sound pulse travels through water it encounters objects that are of different density or acoustic characteristics than the surrounding medium, such as fish, that reflect sound back toward the sound source. These echoes provide information on fish size, location, abundance and behavior. Data is usually processed and analysed using a variety of software such as Echoview. See Also: Hydroacoustics and Fisheries Acoustics.
Wave measurement
An upward looking echo sounder mounted on the bottom or on a platform may be used to make measurements of wave height and period. From this statistics of the surface conditions at a location can be derived.
Water velocity measurement
Special short range sonars have been developed to allow measurements of water velocity.
Bottom type assessment
Sonars have been developed that can be used to characterise the sea bottom into, for example, mud, sand, and gravel. Relatively simple sonars such as echo sounders can be promoted to seafloor classification systems via add-on modules, converting echo parameters into sediment type. Different algorithms exist, but they are all based on changes in the energy or shape of the reflected sounder pings. Advanced substrate classification analysis can be achieved using calibrated (scientific) echosounders and parametric or fuzzy-logic analysis of the acoustic data (See: Acoustic Seabed Classification)
Bathymetric mapping
Side-scan sonars can be used to derive maps of seafloor topography (bathymetry) by moving the sonar across it just above the bottom. Low frequency sonars such as GLORIA have been used for continental shelf wide surveys while high frequency sonars are used for more detailed surveys of smaller areas.
Sub-bottom profiling
Powerful low frequency echo-sounders have been developed for providing profiles of the upper layers of the ocean bottom.
Synthetic aperture sonar
Various synthetic aperture sonars have been built in the laboratory and some have entered use in mine-hunting and search systems. An explanation of their operation is given in synthetic aperture sonar.
Parametric sonar
Parametric sources use the non-linearity of water to generate the difference frequency between two high frequencies. A virtual end-fire array is formed. Such a projector has advantages of broad bandwidth, narrow beamwidth, and when fully developed and carefully measured it has no obvious sidelobes: see Parametric array. Its major disadvantage is very low efficiency of only a few percent.[18] P.J. Westervelt's seminal 1963 JASA paper summarizes the trends involved.
Sonar in extraterrestrial contexts
Use of sonar has been proposed for determining the depth of hydrocarbon seas on Titan.[19]
Effect of sonar on marine life
Effect on marine mammals




A Humpback whale


Further information: Marine mammals and sonar
Research has shown that use of active sonar can lead to mass strandings of marine mammals.[20][21] Beaked whales, the most common casualty of the strandings, have been shown to be highly sensitive to mid-frequency active sonar.[22] Other marine mammals such as the blue whale also flee away from the source of the sonar,[23] while naval activity was suggested to be the most probable cause of a mass stranding of dolphins.[24] The US Navy, which part-funded some of studies, said the findings only showed behavioural responses to sonar, not actual harm, but "will evaluate the effectiveness of [their] marine mammal protective measures in light of new research findings."[20]
Some marine animals, such as whales and dolphins, use echolocation systems, sometimes called biosonar to locate predators and prey. It is conjectured that active sonar transmitters could confuse these animals and interfere with basic biological functions such as feeding and mating.[citation needed]
Effect on fish
High intensity sonar sounds can create a small temporary shift in the hearing threshold of some fish.[25][26] [a]
Frequencies and resolutions
The frequencies of sonars range from infrasonic to above a megahertz. Generally, the lower frequencies have longer range, while the higher frequencies offer better resolution, and smaller size for a given directionality.
To achieve reasonable directionality, frequencies below 1&#160;kHz generally require large size, usually achieved as towed arrays.[27]
Low frequency sonars are loosely defined as 1–5&#160;kHz, albeit some navies regard 5–7&#160;kHz also as low frequency. Medium frequency is defined as 5–15&#160;kHz. Another style of division considers low frequency to be under 1&#160;kHz, and medium frequency at between 1–10&#160;kHz.[27]
American World War II era sonars operated at a relatively high frequency of 20–30&#160;kHz, to achieve directionality with reasonably small transducers, with typical maximum operational range of 2500 yd. Postwar sonars used lower frequencies to achieve longer range; e.g. SQS-4 operated at 10&#160;kHz with range up to 5000 yd. SQS-26 and SQS-53 operated at 3&#160;kHz with range up to 20,000 yd; their domes had size of approx. a 60-ft personnel boat, an upper size limit for conventional hull sonars. Achieving larger sizes by conformal sonar array spread over the hull has not been effective so far, for lower frequencies linear or towed arrays are therefore used.[27]
Japanese WW2 sonars operated at a range of frequencies. The Type 91, with 30 inch quartz projector, worked at 9&#160;kHz. The Type 93, with smaller quartz projectors, operated at 17.5&#160;kHz (model 5 at 16 or 19&#160;kHz magnetostrictive) at powers between 1.7 and 2.5 kilowatts, with range of up to 6&#160;km. The later Type 3, with German-design magnetostrictive transducers, operated at 13, 14.5, 16, or 20&#160;kHz (by model), using twin transducers (except model 1 which had three single ones), at 0.2 to 2.5 kilowatts. The Simple type used 14.5&#160;kHz magnetostrictive transducers at 0.25&#160;kW, driven by capacitive discharge instead of oscillators, with range up to 2.5&#160;km.[11]
The sonar's resolution is angular; objects further apart will be imaged with lower resolutions than nearby ones.
Another source lists ranges and resolutions vs frequencies for sidescan sonars. 30&#160;kHz provides low resolution with range of 1000–6000 m, 100&#160;kHz gives medium resolution at 500–1000 m, 300&#160;kHz gives high resolution at 150–500 m, and 600&#160;kHz gives high resolution at 75–150 m. Longer range sonars are more adversely affected by nonhomogenities of water. Some environments, typically shallow waters near the coasts, have complicated terrain with many features; higher frequencies become necessary there.[28]
As a specific example, the Sonar 2094 Digital, a towed fish capable of reaching depth of 1000 or 2000 meters, performs side-scanning at 114&#160;kHz (600m range at each side, 50 by 1 degree beamwidth) and 410&#160;kHz (150m range, 40 by 0.3 degree beamwidth), with 3&#160;kW pulse power.[29]
A JW Fishers system offers side-scanning at 1200&#160;kHz with very high spatial resolution, optionally coupled with longer-range 600&#160;kHz (range 200&#160;ft at each side) or 100&#160;kHz (up to 2000&#160;ft per side, suitable for scanning large areas for big targets).[30]

				In mathematics, a finite set is a set that has a finite number of elements. For example,



is a finite set with five elements. The number of elements of a finite set is a natural number (a non-negative integer) and is called the cardinality of the set. A set that is not finite is called infinite. For example, the set of all positive integers is infinite:



Finite sets are particularly important in combinatorics, the mathematical study of counting. Many arguments involving finite sets rely on the pigeonhole principle, which states that there cannot exist an injective function from a larger finite set to a smaller finite set.

Definition and terminology[edit]
Formally, a set S is called finite if there exists a bijection



for some natural number n. The number n is the set's cardinality, denoted as |S|. The empty set {} or Ø is considered finite, with cardinality zero.
If a set is finite, its elements may be written — in many ways — in a sequence:



In combinatorics, a finite set with n elements is sometimes called an n-set and a subset with k elements is called a k-subset. For example, the set {5,6,7} is a 3-set&#160;– a finite set with three elements&#160;– and {6,7} is a 2-subset of it.
Basic properties[edit]
Any proper subset of a finite set S is finite and has fewer elements than S itself. As a consequence, there cannot exist a bijection between a finite set S and a proper subset of S. Any set with this property is called Dedekind-finite. Using the standard ZFC axioms for set theory, every Dedekind-finite set is also finite, but this requires at least the axiom of countable choice.
Any injective function between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also a surjective function (a surjection). Similarly, any surjection between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also an injection.
The union of two finite sets is finite, with



In fact:



More generally, the union of any finite number of finite sets is finite. The Cartesian product of finite sets is also finite, with:



Similarly, the Cartesian product of finitely many finite sets is finite. A finite set with n elements has 2n distinct subsets. That is, the power set of a finite set is finite, with cardinality 2n.
Any subset of a finite set is finite. The set of values of a function when applied to elements of a finite set is finite.
All finite sets are countable, but not all countable sets are finite. (Some authors, however, use "countable" to mean "countably infinite", so do not consider finite sets to be countable.)
The free semilattice over a finite set is the set of its non-empty subsets, with the join operation being given by set union.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness[edit]
In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice (ZF), the following conditions are all equivalent:[citation needed]

S is a finite set. That is, S can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of those natural numbers less than some specific natural number.
(Kazimierz Kuratowski) S has all properties which can be proved by mathematical induction beginning with the empty set and adding one new element at a time. (See below for the set-theoretical formulation of Kuratowski finiteness.)
(Paul Stäckel) S can be given a total ordering which is well-ordered both forwards and backwards. That is, every non-empty subset of S has both a least and a greatest element in the subset.
Every one-to-one function from P(P(S)) into itself is onto. That is, the powerset of the powerset of S is Dedekind-finite (see below).[1]
Every surjective function from P(P(S)) onto itself is one-to-one.
(Alfred Tarski) Every non-empty family of subsets of S has a minimal element with respect to inclusion.[2] (Equivalently, every non-empty family of subsets of S has a maximal element with respect to inclusion.)
S can be well-ordered and any two well-orderings on it are order isomorphic. In other words, the well-orderings on S have exactly one order type.

If the axiom of choice is also assumed (the axiom of countable choice is sufficient[citation needed]), then the following conditions are all equivalent:

S is a finite set.
(Richard Dedekind) Every one-to-one function from S into itself is onto.
Every surjective function from S onto itself is one-to-one.
S is empty or every partial ordering of S contains a maximal element.

Foundational issues[edit]
Georg Cantor initiated his theory of sets in order to provide a mathematical treatment of infinite sets. Thus the distinction between the finite and the infinite lies at the core of set theory. Certain foundationalists, the strict finitists, reject the existence of infinite sets and thus advocate a mathematics based solely on finite sets. Mainstream mathematicians consider strict finitism too confining, but acknowledge its relative consistency: the universe of hereditarily finite sets constitutes a model of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation.
Even for those mathematicians who embrace infinite sets, in certain important contexts, the formal distinction between the finite and the infinite can remain a delicate matter. The difficulty stems from Gödel's incompleteness theorems. One can interpret the theory of hereditarily finite sets within Peano arithmetic (and certainly also vice versa), so the incompleteness of the theory of Peano arithmetic implies that of the theory of hereditarily finite sets. In particular, there exists a plethora of so-called non-standard models of both theories. A seeming paradox, non-standard models of the theory of hereditarily finite sets contain infinite sets --- but these infinite sets look finite from within the model. (This can happen when the model lacks the sets or functions necessary to witness the infinitude of these sets.) On account of the incompleteness theorems, no first-order predicate, nor even any recursive scheme of first-order predicates, can characterize the standard part of all such models. So, at least from the point of view of first-order logic, one can only hope to characterize finiteness approximately.
More generally, informal notions like set, and particularly finite set, may receive interpretations across a range of formal systems varying in their axiomatics and logical apparatus. The best known axiomatic set theories include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory (NBG), Non-well-founded set theory, Bertrand Russell's Type theory and all the theories of their various models. One may also choose among classical first-order logic, various higher-order logics and intuitionistic logic.
A formalist might see the meaning of set varying from system to system. A Platonist might view particular formal systems as approximating an underlying reality.
Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness[edit]
In contexts where the notion of natural number sits logically prior to any notion of set, one can define a set S as finite if S admits a bijection to some set of natural numbers of the form . Mathematicians more typically choose to ground notions of number in set theory, for example they might model natural numbers by the order types of finite well-ordered sets. Such an approach requires a structural definition of finiteness that does not depend on natural numbers.
Interestingly, various properties that single out the finite sets among all sets in the theory ZFC turn out logically inequivalent in weaker systems such as ZF or intuitionistic set theories. Two definitions feature prominently in the literature, one due to Richard Dedekind, the other to Kazimierz Kuratowski. (Kuratowski's is the definition used above.)
A set S is called Dedekind infinite if there exists an injective, non-surjective function . Such a function exhibits a bijection between S and a proper subset of S, namely the image of f. Given a Dedekind infinite set S, a function f, and an element x that is not in the image of f, we can form an infinite sequence of distinct elements of S, namely . Conversely, given a sequence in S consisting of distinct elements , we can define a function f such that on elements in the sequence  and f behaves like the identity function otherwise. Thus Dedekind infinite sets contain subsets that correspond bijectively with the natural numbers. Dedekind finite naturally means that every injective self-map is also surjective.
Kuratowski finiteness is defined as follows. Given any set S, the binary operation of union endows the powerset P(S) with the structure of a semi-lattice. Writing K(S) for the sub-semi-lattice generated by the empty set and the singletons, call set S Kuratowski finite if S itself belongs to K(S).[3] Intuitively, K(S) consists of the finite subsets of S. Crucially, one does not need induction, recursion or a definition of natural numbers to define generated by since one may obtain K(S) simply by taking the intersection of all sub-semi-lattices containing the empty set and the singletons.
Readers unfamiliar with semi-lattices and other notions of abstract algebra may prefer an entirely elementary formulation. Kuratowski finite means S lies in the set K(S), constructed as follows. Write M for the set of all subsets X of P(S) such that:

X contains the empty set;
For every set T in P(S), if X contains T then X also contains the union of T with any singleton.

Then K(S) may be defined as the intersection of M.
In ZF, Kuratowski finite implies Dedekind finite, but not vice versa. In the parlance of a popular pedagogical formulation, when the axiom of choice fails badly, one may have an infinite family of socks with no way to choose one sock from more than finitely many of the pairs. That would make the set of such socks Dedekind finite: there can be no infinite sequence of socks, because such a sequence would allow a choice of one sock for infinitely many pairs by choosing the first sock in the sequence. However, Kuratowski finiteness would fail for the same set of socks.
Other concepts of finiteness[edit]
In ZF set theory without the axiom of choice, the following concepts of finiteness for a set S are distinct. They are arranged in strictly decreasing order of strength. In other words, if a set S meets one of the criteria in this list, it meets all of the criteria which follow that one. In the absence of the axiom of choice, the reverse implications are all unprovable. If the axiom of choice is assumed, then all of these concepts are equivalent.[4] (Note that none of these definitions need the set of finite ordinal numbers to be defined first. They are all pure "set-theoretic" definitions in terms of the equality and element-of relations, not involving ω.)

I-finite. Every non-empty set of subsets of S has a ⊆-maximal element. (This is equivalent to requiring the existence of a ⊆-minimal element. It is also equivalent to the standard numerical concept of finiteness.)
Ia-finite. For every partition of S into two sets, at least one of the two sets is I-finite.
II-finite. Every non-empty ⊆-monotone set of subsets of S has a ⊆-maximal element.
III-finite. The power set P(S) is Dedekind finite.
IV-finite. S is Dedekind finite.
V-finite. ∣S∣ = 0 or 2⋅∣S∣ &gt; ∣S|.
VI-finite. ∣S∣ = 0 or ∣S∣ = 1 or ∣S∣² &gt; ∣S|.
VII-finite. S is I-finite or not well-orderable.

The forward implications (from strong to weak) are theorems within ZF. Counter-examples to the reverse implications (from weak to strong) are found using model theory.[5]
Most of these finiteness definitions and their names are attributed to Tarski 1954 by Howard &amp; Rubin 1998, p.&#160;278. However, definitions I, II, III, IV and V were presented in Tarski 1924, pp.&#160;49, 93, together with proofs (or references to proofs) for the forward implications. At that time, model theory was not sufficiently advanced to find the counter-examples.

Notes[edit]


^ The equivalence of the standard numerical definition of finite sets to the Dedekind-finiteness of the power set of the power set was shown in 1912 by Whitehead &amp; Russell 2009, p.&#160;288. This Whitehead/Russell theorem is described in more modern language by Tarski 1924, pp.&#160;73–74.
^ Tarski 1924, pp.&#160;48–58, demonstrated that his definition (which is also known as I-finite) is equivalent to Kuratowski's set-theoretical definition, which he then noted is equivalent to the standard numerical definition via the proof by Kuratowski 1920, pp.&#160;130–131.
^ The original paper by Kuratowski 1920 defined a set S to be finite when

P(S)∖{∅} = ⋂{X ∈ P(P(S)∖{∅}); (∀x∈S, {x}∈X) and (∀A,B∈X, A∪B∈X)}.

In other words, S is finite when the set of all non-empty subsets of S is equal to the intersection of all classes X which satisfy:

all elements of X are non-empty subsets of S,
the set {x} is an element of X for all x in S,
X is closed under pairwise unions.

Kuratowski showed that this is equivalent to the numerical definition of a finite set.
^ This list of 8 finiteness concepts is presented with this numbering scheme by both Howard &amp; Rubin 1998, pp.&#160;278–280, and Lévy 1958, pp.&#160;2–3, although the details of the presentation of the definitions differ in some respects which do not affect the meanings of the concepts.
^ Lévy 1958 found counter-examples to each of the reverse implications in Mostowski models. Lévy attributes most of the results to earlier papers by Mostowski and Lindenbaum.
