History[edit]
Palgrave is named after the Palgrave family. Classical historian Sir Francis Palgrave, who founded the Public Record Office, and his four sons were all closely tied with Macmillan Publishers in the 19th century:

Francis Turner Palgrave acted as assistant private secretary to future Prime Minister Gladstone, before creating his Palgrave's Golden Treasury [1] in the English Language in 1861, which was published by Macmillan and became a standard work for almost a century.


Sir Inglis Palgrave or Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave was the editor of The Palgrave Dictionary of Political Economy, which was first published by Macmillan in 1894, 1896 and 1899 and the inspiration for The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics published in 1987.[2] He was a banker and editor of The Economist.


Sir Reginald Palgrave or Sir Reginald Francis Douce was Clerk of the House of Commons and wrote a History of the House of Commons, which Macmillan published in 1869.


William Gifford Palgrave was a brilliant Arabic scholar. He wrote a two-volume work describing his travels and adventures for Macmillan called Narrative of a Year’s Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia (1865), which was the most widely read book on the region until the account by T. E. Lawrence was published.

Palgrave Macmillan publishes The Statesman's Yearbook. This classic reference work presents a political, economic and social account of every country of the world together with facts and analysis. In 2008, Palgrave Macmillan published The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd edition, edited by Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. In 2009 Palgrave Macmillan made over 4,500 scholarly ebooks available to libraries.
In May 2015 Palgrave Macmillan was merged with other companies to form Springer Nature.[3]
