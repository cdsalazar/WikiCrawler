Mission and values[edit]
SportAccord is the umbrella organisation for both Olympic and non-Olympic international sports federations as well as organisers of international sporting events and in this case provide expertise in, for example, anti-doping, integrity, social responsibility.[2]
By establishing multi-sports games that group together similar sports, the SportAccord aims to promote the members and the members visibility.[2]
Definition of sport[edit]
The SportAccord has developed a definition of sport to determine whether an applicant federation qualifies as an international sports federation.
SportAccord's definition of Sport is the following definition:[3]

The sport proposed should include an element of competition.
The sport should not rely on any element of “luck” specifically integrated into the sport.
The sport should not be judged to pose an undue risk to the health and safety of its athletes or participants.
The sport proposed should in no way be harmful to any living creature.
The sport should not rely on equipment that is provided by a single supplier.

SportAccord uses five categories for its member federations' sports, many of which fall into more than one category:

Primarily physical (e.g. rugby or athletics)
Primarily mind (e.g. chess or go)
Primarily motorised (e.g. Formula One or powerboating)
Primarily coordination (e.g. billiards)
Primarily animal-supported (e.g. equestrianism)

Membership[edit]
SportAccord operates with two term of membership. First of the international federation can be Full Member or secondary be Associate Member of SportAccord.[4]
History[edit]
The SportAccord is deeply rooted in the sports movement. As early as 1921, international sports federations (IFs) expressed the need for a representative of their common objectives and interests. Under the direction of Paul Rousseau, Secretary General of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), a permanent bureau of the IFs was established to facilitate the dialogue with the Olympic authorities.[citation needed]
In 1967, 26 international sports federations met in Lausanne and agreed on the need to increase permanent liaisons and the name “General Assembly of International Sports Federations” was adopted. In order to establish a more formalised organisation, the “General Association of International Sports Federations" (GAISF) was formed in 1976 and the headquarters were moved to Monaco two years later.
The new millennium brought important changes to the organisation. Reacting to the increasing pressure on IFs to professionalise and develop, GAISF in collaboration with the Associations of Summer and Winter Olympic International Federations (ASOIF and AIOWF), launched first SportAccord International Convention in 2003. At the time, this new format “by sport for sport” allows IFs and sports business to get together, share knowledge and network.
In March 2009, GAISF was rebranded SportAccord and, in the same year, its offices moved to Lausanne, the Olympic Capital. SportAccord officially adopted the mission to UNITE &amp; SUPPORT and developed into a dynamic and active organisation which aims to serve and promote its members. Its ambition is to provide high-quality services and expertise in areas that are of high importance to its members.
Currently, SportAccord’s focus is on sports’ social responsibility, sports’ integrity, doping-free sport, digital media and multi-sports games.
1920s
As early as 1921, under the direction of Paul ROUSSEAU, Secretary General of the “Union Cycliste Internationale”, a permanent bureau of the international sports federations (IFs) was created. With regular IFs/IOC meetings taking place, dialogue with the Olympic authorities became easier. However, organisations that were not part of the Olympic movement were excluded.
1960s
In the 1960s, the sports movement evolved rapidly.
Roger Coulon, President of the “Fédération Internationale de Lutte Amateur”, was the first to express the need, for a wider recognition of the role of IFs. For non-Olympic federations, a forum which would enable them to better express their points of view was necessary. The creation of a stable organisation ensuring permanent relations between IFs appeared to be the logical continuation of the meetings which took place frequently but without rules or a fixed organisation. The common preparation of these meetings with the IOC could thus be better supported. It would also permit a constant liaison between the IFs and the outside world. In 1966, the time seemed appropriate and the convocation to the newly constituted Assembly was launched.
1967
On 21–23 April 1967, delegates from the following 26 international sports federations met in Lausanne in the Hotel Continental: Aeronautics, Rowing, Basketball, Bobsleigh, Boules, Canoeing, Cycling, Equestrian, Fencing, Gymnastics, Handball, Hockey, Ice Hockey, Judo, Luge, Wrestling, Motorcycling, Swimming, Modern Pentathlon, Roller-Skating, Skiing, Shooting, Volleyball, Weightlifting, University Sport, and Maccabi.
The delegates agreed on the necessity to establish permanent liaisons between the IFs, for the defence of their objectives and common goals, the preservation of their autonomy and constant exchange of information. The name “General Assembly of International Sports Federations” was adopted.
In 1976, this name was replaced by “General Association of International Sports Federations” (GAISF). In 1978, the office moved from Lausanne to Monaco. GAISF represented the logical continuation of the past IFs meetings, dealing not only with Olympic matters but also with all questions of common interest for the IFs.
2000s
In 2003, in collaboration with ASOIF and AIOWF, GAISF launched the first SportAccord Convention to answer a need from the IFs, which were looking to have a “one-stop-shop”, where they could all hold their annual meetings, be encouraged to network and share their knowledge.
In March 2009, GAISF was rebranded SportAccord at the meeting of the 7th SportAccord International Convention in Denver. In April 2009, it moved its main office from Monaco to Maison du Sport International in Lausanne, Switzerland. Due to the growing ambitions of SportAccord, the team is continuously growing.[5]
On May 25, 2012, the last of eight days of the annual General Assembly of SportAccord in Quebec City, the Federation of International Lacrosse and the International Mind Sports Association were accepted, bringing "the number of SportAccord members to 107".[6]
On May 31, 2013, the last of eight days of the annual General Assembly of SportAccord in Saint Petersburg, the International Cheer Union and the Federation Internationale de I'Automobile were voted into SportAccord.[7]
On April 20, 2015, at SportAccord's 2015 convention in Sochi, SportAccord president Marius Vizer made a speech that was sharply critical of the IOC and its president, Thomas Bach. Following the speech, the IAAF, the ISSF, and World Archery withdrew from SportAccord in protest,[8] and there were a number of further withdrawals in May 2015 including the International Rowing Federation.[9]

The SportAccord International Convention[edit]
Originally launched in 2003, SportAccord International Convention is a gathering of more than 2,500 leading representatives from the sport industry. It offers the participants a powerful opportunity to come together on a global scale, in an exclusive and authoritative networking environment, to build relationships, share knowledge and develop ideas that will benefit the entire community.[11]
Unlike any other event of its type, SportAccord International Convention is owned and endorsed by the sports movement itself. It was created and is owned by SportAccord, the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) and the Association of International Olympic Winter Federations (AIOWF). Over the past decade, SportAccord International Convention has become one of the key fixtures on the world-wide sporting calendar. It allows associations as well as the international sports federations to increase efficiency by holding all their annual meetings at the same time and place, and serves also as a commercial platform whereby the sports industry can have 'one-stop-shop' access to the world governing bodies of sport and their key decision-makers.[12]
