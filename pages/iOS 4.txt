iOS 4 is the fourth version of the iOS mobile operating system designed by Apple Inc.. It was released on June 21, 2010, and was the first major release to be renamed to simply "iOS", and the first major release to drop support for some devices, as well as the first update that iPod Touch users did not have to pay for.
The iPhone 3G and 2nd generation iPod Touch lack multitasking capabilities and the ability to set a home screen wallpaper, while the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, 3rd and 4th generation iPod Touch have them. The iPhone and the 1st generation iPod Touch cannot run iOS 4 and above.
iOS 4.2.1, released November 22, 2010, added iPad compatibility. It was the last to support iPhone 3G and iPod Touch (2nd generation, MB &amp; MC models).
iOS 4.0 was released to the public and supported only the iPhone and iPod touch. iOS 4.0 was announced to have over 1500 new APIs for developers, supporting the highly anticipated multitasking feature. The final iOS version for the 2nd generation iPod Touch and iPhone 3G is iOS 4.2.1. iOS 4.2.1 was the first version to bring major feature parity to the iPhone and iPad. The release of the CDMA iPhone 4 for Verizon Wireless saw a branching of iOS. The 4.2 version sequence continued for the CDMA iPhone 4 while iOS 4.3 was released for all other products. iOS 4.3.5 was the final release on iOS 4.

Features
iOS 4 added features such as multitasking, folders, and home screen wallpapers. Multitasking and home screen wallpapers were not available on the iPhone 3G and the iPod touch (2nd generation).
iOS 4.1 added a new app called Game Center, though not available on the iPhone 3G.
Problems
iPhone 3G users reported performance and battery issues. Apple released iOS 4.1 and 4.2.1 in attempt to fix the performance issues.
Some iPhone 4 users have reported technical problems with the antennas. Apple eventually released iOS 4.2.1 and the CDMA Verizon iPhone 4 running iOS 4.2.2 in attempt to fix the problem.
