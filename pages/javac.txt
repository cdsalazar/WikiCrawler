javac (pronounced "java-see", or often "javack") is the primary Java compiler, included in the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle Corporation.
The compiler accepts source code conforming to the Java language specification (JLS) and produces bytecode conforming to the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS).
javac is itself written in Java. The compiler can also be invoked programmatically.[2]

History[edit]
On 13 November 2006, Sun's Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Java Development Kit (JDK) were made available[3] under the GPL license (see Sun's OpenJDK Hotspot page).
Since version 0.95, GNU Classpath, a free implementation of the Java Class Library, supports compiling and running javac using the Classpath runtime (GIJ) and compiler (GCJ), and also allows one to compile the GNU Classpath class library, tools and examples with javac itself.[4]
