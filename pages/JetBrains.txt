History[edit]
JetBrains, initially called IntelliJ,[7] was founded in 2000 in Prague by three software developers:[8] Sergey Dmitriev, Valentin Kipiatkov and Eugene Belyaev.[9]
The company's first product was IntelliJ Renamer, a tool for refactoring Java code.[2]
In 2012, after having been the company's CEO for 12 years, Sergey Dmitriev entrusted the company to two newly appointed CEOs, Oleg Stepanov and Maxim Shafirov, and devoted himself to his scientific endeavors in the field of bioinformatics.[10][11]
Products[edit]
The company offers an extended family of IDEs for Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, Objective-C, C++, and other programming languages.[12]
JetBrains are also the makers of tools for .NET developers, including ReSharper, dotTrace, dotMemory, dotCover and dotPeek, plus team development tools: TeamCity for continuous integration and build management, YouTrack for issue tracking and UpSource for code review.[13][14]
In 2011 the company entered a new area by introducing Kotlin, a new JVM programming language.[12]

CLion[edit]
CLion (pronounced "sea lion") is a cross-platform C/C++ IDE for Linux, OS X, and Windows integrated with the CMake build system.[15][16] The initial version will support the GCC and Clang compilers and GDB debugger, with JetBrains hoping to support LLDB and Google Test in the future.[17] The Forrester analyst Michael Facemire expressed doubts about the product's potential.[17]
Revenue model[edit]
JetBrains IDEs have several license options, which feature same software functionality and differ in their price and terms of use. The team products are available as hosted and installed versions and have free versions for small teams.[18][19] All products are free for open source projects and educational institutions.[20]
IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is one of the only paid products in a field of free or open source options.[21][22][23]
Open source projects[edit]
In 2009, JetBrains open-sourced the core functionality of IntelliJ IDEA by offering the free Community Edition.[20][24] It is built on the IntelliJ Platform and includes its sources. JetBrains has applied the Apache 2.0 license to both of them.[25] In 2010, Android support became a part of the Community Edition,[26] and two years later Google announced[27] its Android Studio, the IDE for mobile development on Android platform built on the Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA and an official alternative to Eclipse Android Developer Tool.[28] In June 2015, it was announced that the support of Eclipse ADT will be discontinued making the Android Studio the official tool for Android App development.[29]
MPS, short for Meta Programming System, and Project Kotlin, a statically typed programming language for JVM, are both open source and non-commercial.[30][31]
Past projects[edit]
Fabrique, a RAD framework for building custom Web and enterprise applications.[32] Introduced in 2004,[32] apparently dead since 2008.
Omea, a desktop-based reader and organizer for RSS (and later of every bit of information that comes across one’s desktop),[33] the first[34] and so far the only consumer-oriented product from JetBrains. Introduced in 2004, it failed to gain expected popularity.[33] In 2008, having reached v 2.2, Omea was open-sourced under the GPL v2 license.[35] The product is still available for download, and after the "retirement"[36] of Google Reader, has gained some attention again.[33][37]
Astella, an IDE for Flash and Flex. This most short-lived JetBrains product was announced in October 2011,[38] just a month before Adobe killed Mobile Flash.[39]
