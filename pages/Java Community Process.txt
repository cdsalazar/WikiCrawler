				The Java Community Process (JCP), established in 1998, is a formalized mechanism that allows interested parties to develop standard technical specifications for Java technology. Anyone can become a JCP Member by filling a form available at the JCP website. JCP membership for organizations and commercial entities requires annual fees but is free for individuals.[1]
The JCP involves the use of Java Specification Requests (JSRs)&#160;â€“ the formal documents that describe proposed specifications and technologies for adding to the Java platform. Formal public reviews of JSRs take place before a JSR becomes final and the JCP Executive Committee votes on it. A final JSR provides a reference implementation that is a free implementation of the technology in source code form and a Technology Compatibility Kit to verify the API specification.
A JSR describes the JCP itself. As of 2009[update], JSR 215 describes the current version (2.7) of the JCP.

Criticism[edit]
The JCP's executive board has been characterized as a "rubber stamp organization" since Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems, the original developer of the language.[10] The Apache Software Foundation resigned its seat on the board in December 2010 because Oracle was unwilling to license the Technology Compatibility Kit for Apache's version of Java.[11]
JCP Program and Industry Awards[12][edit]
10th Annual JCP Award Winners:[13] JCP Member/Participant of the Year: London Java Community and SouJava * Winner * For their historic contribution to the Adopt a JSR program and supporting Java developers through the JCP.
Outstanding Spec Lead: Victor Grazi, Credit Suisse (JSR 354 | Java Money &amp; Currency API) * Winner * For his dedicated, focused expertise in solving issues representing money and currencies.

Notes[edit]


^ "Becoming a JCP Member". Retrieved 11 June 2011.&#160;
^ JSR 3 originally specified the JMX 1.0 release. Two subsequent "final" releases have provided JMX 1.1 and JMX 1.2. JMX 2.0 is specified by JSR 255.
^ JSR 52 originally specified the JSTL 1.0 release. A subsequent maintenance release provided JSTL 1.1.
^ JSR 56 originally specified the JNLP 1.0 release. A subsequent "final" release [1] provided JNLP 1.5, which was primarily a maintenance release. As of February, 2006, the JNLP 6.0 maintenance release has been completed but not finalized.
^ JSR 63 originally specified the JAXP 1.1 release. A subsequent maintenance release of JSR 63 provided the JAXP 1.2 specification.[2] JAXP 1.3 is specified by JSR 206.
^ JSR 127 originally specified the JSF 1.0 release. A subsequent maintenance release provided the JSF 1.1 specification.[3] JSF 1.2 is specified by JSR 252.
^ JSR 154 originally specified the Java Servlet 2.4 release. As of February, 2006 a maintenance draft of the 2.5 servlet specification is under review, scheduled to close on March 20, 2006.
^ JSR 913 originally specified JCP 2.0. It was subsequently amended by various changes to voting rules to produce version 2.1 and then further changed by licensing rules, policy, and processes to get to version 2.5. JCP 2.6 is defined by JSR 215.[4]
^ JSR 924 originally specified changes to the JVM to support changes in J2SE 5.0. As of 2006[update] a maintenance update to support changes proposed by JSR 202 is underway.
