'Level of abstraction' redirects here.

The amount of complexity by which a system is viewed or programmed. The higher the level, the less detail. The lower the level, the more detail. The highest level of abstraction is the entire system. The next level would be a handful of components, and so on, while the lowest level could be millions of objects.[1]
The principle of abstraction is a grouping principle, whereby a hierarchy is adhered to with higher levels of abstraction placed near the top with more specific concepts underneath.
In argument mapping, the principle of abstraction requires that subjective conclusions are supported by less subjective lemmas, which are eventually supported by objective, or near objective premises and/or basis boxes.
Example[edit]
For the teaching (not personnel) organization of a university the levels of abstraction would go something like this.
