Hopscotch


A street game is a sport or game that is played on city streets rather than a prepared field. Street games are usually simply play time activities for children in the most convenient venue. However some street games have risen to the level of organized tournaments, such as stickball.
When street games are based on organized sports the rules are usually highly modified to fit the situation, i.e. manhole covers for bases with cars or buildings for foul lines in stickball. When balls are called for in street games, spaldeens are often used.
