				C++03 refers to a version of the C++ programming language as defined in standard ISO/IEC 14882:2003.
This version of the C++ programming language standard replaced the standard referred to as C++98, which represented the language's first international standard. In essence, C++03 does not provide any changes to the core language;[1] however, it addresses many defects in the language description of the previous version of the standard.[1]
Among the more noteworthy changes to existing parts of the standard library, C++03 added the requirement that elements in a vector are stored contiguously.[2] This codifies the common expectation that a C++ std::vector object uses a memory layout similar to an array. While most implementations satisfied this expectation, it was not previously required by the standard document.
