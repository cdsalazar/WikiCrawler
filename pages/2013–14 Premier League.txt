The 2013–14 Premier League (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) was the 22nd season of the Premier League, the top-flight English professional league for men's association football clubs. The fixtures were announced on 19 June 2013. The season started on Saturday 17 August 2013, and concluded on Sunday 11 May 2014.
On the final day of the season, Manchester City won the Premier League with a 2–0 victory over West Ham United, finishing with 86 points. Liverpool had looked on course to win the title with two weeks to go, but a loss and a draw in two of their last three matches left the team in second place with 84 points. Chelsea placed third, Arsenal, who led the League for the longest period placed fourth, while 2013 champions Manchester United had a disappointing season and ended up seventh. Norwich City, Fulham, and Cardiff City were the bottom three teams and were relegated to the Football League Championship.
Luis Suárez won the scoring title with 31 goals, and was also named Player of the Season. Goalkeepers Wojciech Szczęsny of Arsenal and Petr Čech of Chelsea led the league with 16 clean sheets each. Tony Pulis of Crystal Palace won the Manager of the Season award.

Teams
A total of 20 teams contested the league, including 17 sides from the 2012–13 season[4] and three promoted from the 2012–13 Football League Championship.[5]
On 16 April 2013, Cardiff City earned promotion from the 2012–13 Football League Championship. They returned to the top division after being absent for 51 years.[6] This is the first season which Cardiff City take part in the Premier League. This season features both Cardiff City and Swansea City which means that it is the first time the South Wales derby is featured in the top flight.[7] It is also the first time that two clubs outside of England are featured in the top flight of English football in the same season.
On 4 May 2013, Hull City earned promotion to the Premier League after a brief absence of three seasons. Hull needed to beat Cardiff City on the final day of the season to maintain second place, but a draw was sufficient following Watford's dramatic loss at home to Leeds United.[8]
On 27 May 2013, Crystal Palace claimed the final promotion place, after beating Watford in the Football League Championship play-off final[9] with Kevin Phillips converting the winning penalty in extra time. Palace are playing in the Premier League for the first time since the 2004–05 season.
The three teams promoted replace Queens Park Rangers, Reading and Wigan Athletic who were all relegated to the Championship at the end of the previous season.

Season summary
The 380 fixtures for the 2013–14 Premier League season were announced on 19 June 2013. The television broadcast rights were given two-to-three weeks later. The season started on Saturday 17 August 2013, and concluded on Sunday 11 May 2014.[75] During the 2013–14 season, the Premier League used goal-line technology for the first time.[76]
During the 2013–14 season, first place changed hands 25 times, compared to just four times during the 2012–13 season. That represented the most lead changes since the 2001–02 season – which had 29, the most ever. The championship was not decided until the final day of play for just the seventh time in league history.[50] Manchester City won the league with a 2–0 victory over West Ham United on the final day, finishing with 86 points.[77] In total, Manchester City led the league just 14 days throughout the season en route to their second championship in the last three seasons. The club scored 102 goals, one short of the record, while also conceding the second fewest goals in the league.[50]
With two weeks to go, Liverpool looked like having a chance to win the championship before they had a loss and a draw in two of their final three games.[78] The team ended up in second place with 84 points. Chelsea came third, while perennial power and 2013 champions Manchester United had a disappointing season under new manager David Moyes (who was sacked in April) and finished seventh.[50] It was their first finish outside the top four in Premier League history, their worst finish overall since 1989–90, and the first time they had not qualified for European football in 25 years.[79] Southampton's eighth-place finish and Everton's 72 points were club records.
Sunderland became only the second team in the Premier League era to avoid relegation having been bottom of the table on Christmas Day.[50] Defeat at home to Everton on 12 April left Gus Poyet's side bottom of the table, seven points from safety (albeit with two games in hand). The club's 'great escape' [80] began with a draw away at eventual champions Manchester City, followed by a run of four wins, including remarkable away victories at Chelsea and Manchester United. The side's survival was confirmed by a 2-0 victory over West Bromwich Albion on 7 May. Norwich City, Fulham, and Cardiff City were the bottom three teams and were relegated to the Football League Championship.
Two teams (Manchester City and Liverpool) scored more than 100 goals for the first time in league history. The feat has only once been achieved before – by Chelsea in 2009–10. Luis Suárez easily won the golden boot for most goals with 31, ahead of team-mate Daniel Sturridge who came second with 21 goals. Wojciech Szczęsny of Arsenal and Petr Čech of Chelsea led the league with 16 clean sheets each. In a game against Southampton, Asmir Begovic became just the fifth goalkeeper in league history to score.[50] Begovic's goal was also the fastest of the season, occurring just 12 seconds into the game.[81] Mile Jedinak had the most tackles with 133. Chelsea manager José Mourinho lost a home game for the first time in his Premier League career losing to Sunderland, ending a run of 77 straight home games unbeaten stretching over two stints as Chelsea manager.[50]
