Customized Geany IDE


Geany (IPA:ʒeːniː) is a lightweight "cross-platform" GUI based text editor[2] using Scintilla and GTK+, including basic Integrated Development Environment (IDE) features. It is designed to have short load times, with limited dependency on separate packages or external libraries. It is available for a wide range of operating systems, such as BSD, Linux, Mac OS X,[3] Solaris and Windows. Among the supported programming languages and markup languages are C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, LaTeX, CSS, Python, Perl, Ruby, Pascal, Haskell, Erlang, Vala and many others.[4]
In contrast to traditional Unix-based editors like Emacs or Vim, Geany more closely resembles programming editors available for Microsoft Windows such as Programmer's Notepad or Notepad++, both of which also use Scintilla.
It is free software licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2 or later.[1] After version 0.21 the next version was numbered 1.22 as requested by many users to reflect the maturity of the product.[5]
