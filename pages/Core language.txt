In computer programming, core language refers to the primary components and features of a programming language, possibly including any standard libraries. A core language typically includes definitions of the types the language provides and rules about the syntax and semantics.[1] The term has been used to describe the core features of C and C++,[2] Java,[3] Web Services Description Language[4] and in research papers.[5] The core language represents the boundary between what's in a language and what's not. Anything not in the language has to be added, either by writing it in the language, typically as a library, or through some sort of interface to an external application or system. Basic proficiency in a language is often understood to mean proficiency in the core language.[6]
