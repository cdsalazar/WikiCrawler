This page links to catalogs of libraries, booksellers, and other book sources where you will be able to search for the book with ISBN. If you arrived at this page by clicking an ISBN number link in a Wikipedia page, then the links below (those labeled "find this book") search for the specific book using that ISBN number. Enter another ISBN number in the ISBN search form to change the search links below. Spaces and dashes in the ISBN number do not matter. Note: The number starts after the colon for "ISBN-10:" and "ISBN-13:" numbers.&#160;

Notes
 An ISBN identifies a specific edition of a book. Any given title may therefore have a number of different ISBNs. See xISBN below for finding other editions.
 An ISBN registration, even one corresponding to a book page on a major book distributor database, is not definite proof that such a book actually exists. A title may have been cancelled or postponed after the ISBN was assigned. Both ISBN and other registration have been abused in attempted hoaxes on Wikipedia in the past, so check to see if the book exists or not.

Lists of book sources focused on other languages
The links under the language names displayed on the table below are driving to other book sources available on other linguistic editions of Wikipedia.

 All the existing ISBN-10 prefixes are also remapped into ISBN-13 using the "978-" EAN/UCC prefix for all new publications, and this EAN space is still the one used by most publishers.
 Newer prefixes, used only in ISBN-13, have already started to be allocated into the "979-" EAN/UCC prefix.
