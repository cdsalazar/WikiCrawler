				For the American football player, see Norman Gibbs (Canadian football).
Norman E. Gibbs (November 27, 1941 - April 25, 2002) was an American software engineer, scholar and educational leader.
He studied to a B.Sc. in mathematics at Ursinus College (1964) and M.Sc. (1966) and Ph.D. (1969) in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by Robert R. Korfhage. His research area was cycle generation, an area in graph theory.[1] Gibbs joined the faculty at Bowdoin College in Maine, Arizona State University and College of William and Mary (mathematics) in Virginia before moving to Pittsburgh, joining Carnegie Mellon University as professor of computer science and becoming the first director of the educational program at the Software Engineering Institute (1987–97). Since then he was chief information officer at Guilford College in Greensboro and University of Connecticut, jointly serving as professor of Operations and Information management. He eventually worked for Ball State University as chair of computer science (2000–02).[2]
