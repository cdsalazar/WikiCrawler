				SIGCSE is the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education, which provides a forum for educators to discuss issues related to the development, implementation, and/or evaluation of computing programs, curricula, and courses, as well as syllabi, laboratories, and other elements of teaching and pedagogy. It is also the name of one of the three annual events organized by SIGCSE. This event, a.k.a. ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, is held annually in February or March in the USA. SIGCSE also sponsors an annual conference in or around Europe, named ITiCSE (Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education), usually in late June, and an annual research workshop named ICER (International Computing Education Research), at varied locations, usually in August.
Most of the focus of SIGCSE is on higher level education, though discussions often drift into improving education at the high school level and below. The membership level has held steady at around 3300 members for several years. The current chair of SIGCSE is Susan H. Rodger for July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2016.

Conferences[edit]
SIGCSE has three annual conferences.

The SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education - This annual conference is held in the United States and is attended by around 1300 people. The next one is in March 2016 in Memphis, Tennessee.[1]
The annual conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). The next one will be held in June 2015 in Vilnius, Lithuania.[2] This conference is attended by about 200-300 and is mainly held in Europe, but has also been held in countries outside of Europe (Turkey - 2010) and (Israel - 2012).
The International Computing Education Research (ICER) Conference. This conference has about 70 attendees and is held in the United States every other year. On the alternate years it rotates between Europe and Australasia. The next conference will be held in August 2015 in Omaha, Nebraska.[3]

Newsletter/Bulletin[edit]
The SIGCSE Bulletin is a quarterly newsletter that was first published in 1969. It evolved from an informal gathering of news and ideas to a venue for columns, editor-reviewed articles, research announcements, editorials, symposium proceedings, etc.
In 2010, with the inception of ACM Inroads magazine, the Bulletin was transformed into an electronic newsletter sent to all SIGCSE members providing communications about SIGCSE: announcing activities, publicizing events, and highlighting topics of interest. In other words it has returned to its roots.
