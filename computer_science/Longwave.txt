In radio, longwave refers to parts of the radio spectrum with relatively long wavelengths. The term is a historic one dating from the early 20th century, when the radio spectrum was considered to consist of long, medium and short wavelengths. Most modern radio systems and devices use wavelengths which would then have been considered 'ultra-short'.
In contemporary usage, the term longwave is not defined precisely and its meaning varies across the world. Most commonly it refers to radio wavelengths longer than 1000 meters (frequencies less than 300&#160;kHz),[1][2][3] including the ITU's low frequency (LF) (30–300&#160;kHz) and very low frequency (VLF) (3–30&#160;kHz) bands. Sometimes part of the medium frequency (MF) band (300–3000&#160;kHz) is included.[4]
In Europe, Africa and large parts of Asia (ITU Region 1), where a range of frequencies between 148.5 and 283.5 kHz is used for AM broadcasting (in addition to the medium wave band), the term longwave usually refers specifically to this broadcasting band.
The Region 1 longwave broadcast band falls wholly within the low frequency band of the radio spectrum (30–300&#160;kHz). Broader definitions of longwave may extend below and/or above it. In the US, the Longwave Club of America is interested in "frequencies below the AM broadcast band",[5] i.e., all frequencies below 535&#160;kHz. (Lower frequencies correspond to longer wavelengths.)

Non-broadcast use[edit]
Non-directional beacons[edit]
Main article: Non-directional beacon
Non-directional beacons transmit continuously for the benefit of radio direction finders in marine and aeronautical navigation. They identify themselves by a callsign in Morse code. They can occupy any frequency in the range 190–1750&#160;kHz. In North America they occupy 190–535&#160;kHz. In ITU Region 1 the lower limit is 280&#160;kHz.
Time signals[edit]
There are stations in the range 40–80&#160;kHz that transmit time signals to radio clocks. For example:

WWVB in Colorado on 60&#160;kHz.
DCF77 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany on 77.5&#160;kHz.
JJY in Japan on 40 &amp; 60&#160;kHz.
66.66&#160;kHz in Taldom transmitter, Russia.
BPC in Lintong, China 68.5&#160;kHz.
MSF time and 60&#160;kHz frequency standard transmitted from Anthorn in the UK

Radio controlled clocks receive their time calibrations signal with built-in longwave receivers. They use longwave, rather than shortwave or mediumwave, because the accuracy of the clocks is not affected by changes in the time signal's travel from the transmitter to the ionosphere and to the receiver; as longwave travels by groundwave, rather than skywave, the propagation time does not vary.
Military communication[edit]
The United Kingdom, Russian Federation, United States, Germany, and Sweden use frequencies below 50&#160;kHz to communicate with their submarines.
LowFER[edit]
In North America during the 1970s the frequencies 167, 179 and 191&#160;kHz were assigned to the short-lived Public Emergency Radio of the United States. Nowadays 136&#160;kHz and the 160–190&#160;kHz range is used in the United States for Part 15 LowFER amateur and experimental stations, and the 190–435&#160;kHz band is used for navigational beacons.
Historic[edit]
Swedish station SAQ, located at the Varberg Radio Station facility in Grimeton, is the last remaining operational Alexanderson alternator transmitter. Although the station ended regular service in 1996, it has been maintained as a World Heritage Site and makes at least two demonstration transmissions yearly, on 17.2&#160;kHz.[6]
Broadcasting[edit]
Longwave is used for broadcasting only within ITU Region 1. The longwave broadcasters are located in west, north, central and southeast Europe, the former Soviet Union, Mongolia, Algeria and Morocco.
Typically, a larger area can be covered by a longwave broadcast transmitter than a medium-wave one. This is because ground-wave propagation suffers less attenuation due to limited ground conductivity at lower frequencies.[7]
Carrier frequencies[edit]
Carrier frequencies are exact multiples of 9&#160;kHz ranging from 153 to 279&#160;kHz, except for a French language station Europe #1 in Germany. This station did keep to correctly spaced channels spacing for 4 months—only 7 years ago—and all Mongolian transmitters are spaced at 10&#160;kHz.
Until the 1970s, some longwave stations in northern and eastern Europe and the Soviet Union operated on frequencies as high as 433&#160;kHz.[8]
Some stations, for instance Droitwich in the UK, derive their carrier frequencies from an atomic clock. They can be therefore used as frequency standards. Droitwich also broadcasts a low bit-rate data channel, using narrow-shift phase-shift keying of the carrier, for Radio Teleswitch Services.
In January 2014 Russia closed all of its LW broadcast transmitters except for one in Caucasus, which was shut down in 2015.[9]
Long distance reception[edit]
Because longwave signals can travel very long distances, some radio amateurs and shortwave listeners engage in an activity called DXing. DXers attempt to listen in to far away transmissions, and they often will send a reception report to the sending station to let them know where they were heard. After receiving a report, the sending station may mail the listener a QSL card to acknowledge this reception.
The longest distance over which a longwave broadcast has been received is 10,275 kilometres (6,385&#160;mi). It occurred on July 26, 2015, when Daniel Wyllyans of Nova Xavantina, Mato Grosso, Brazil, received Radio Antena Satelor on 153&#160;kHz from Braşov, Romania.[citation needed] In months prior, Daniel was also able to receive Europe 1 on 183&#160;kHz from France and Radio Medi 1 in Morocco on 171&#160;kHz.
