The slow programming movement is part of the slow movement. It is a software development philosophy that emphasises careful design, quality code, software testing and thinking. It strives to avoid kludges, buggy code, and overly quick release cycles.
Overly quick release cycles can prevent programmers from taking the time to write proper code, think through designs, and get enough rest for them to work effectively; there have been reports of overworked software teams actually losing ground by working extra hours. Due to exhaustion, the programmers introduce more bugs into their code than they can fix.[1]
