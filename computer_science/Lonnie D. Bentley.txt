Life and work[edit]
Born in 1957, Bentley attended the Mountain Home High School in Arkansas. He studied at the Arkansas State University, where in 1979 he received his B.S. in Business Data Processing, and in 1981 his M.S. in Information Systems.
Bentley has taught courses such as Systems Analysis and Design Methods; Systems Analysis (using structured analysis-based methods); Systems Analysis (using information engineering-based methods); Systems Design (using RAD design-based methods); Systems Design (using structured design-based methods); Enterprise Resource Planning and Integration; Business Process Redesign.[2]
Aside from systems analysis and design, Bentley also focuses on enterprise applications, business process redesign, computer-aided software engineering (CASE), rapid application development (RAD), and graphical user interface (GUI) design.
Along with his contributions to higher education, Lonnie is also a founder of Broadband Antenna Tracking Systems (BATS).[3]
