The University of Florida (commonly referred to as Florida or UF) is an American public land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant research university located on a 2,000-acre (8.1&#160;km2) campus in North Central Florida. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida and traces its historical origins to 1853,[8] and has operated continuously on its present Gainesville campus since September 1906.[9]
The University of Florida is one of sixty-two elected member institutions of the Association of American Universities (AAU), the association of preeminent North American research universities, and the only AAU member university located in Florida.[10] The University is classified as a Research University with Very High Research by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.[11] Following the creation of performance standards by the Florida state legislature in 2013, the Florida Board of Governors designated the University of Florida as one of the two "preeminent universities" among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida.[12][13] In 2015, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Florida as the fourteenth best public university in the United States.[14]
The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). It is the third largest Florida university by student population,[15] and is the eighth largest single-campus university in the United States with 49,913 students enrolled for the fall 2012 semester.[16] The University of Florida is home to sixteen academic colleges and more than 150 research centers and institutes. It offers multiple graduate professional programs—including business administration, engineering, law, dentistry, medicine, and veterinary medicine—on one contiguous campus, and administers 123 master's degree programs and seventy-six doctoral degree programs in eighty-seven schools and departments.
The University of Florida's intercollegiate sports teams, commonly known by their "Florida Gators" nickname, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). In their 108-year history, the university's varsity sports teams have won thirty-five national team championships, thirty of which are NCAA titles, and Gator athletes have won 275 individual national championships.[17]

History[edit]
Main article: History of the University of Florida




Century Tower, begun in 1953, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the founding of university and as a tribute to the alumni who perished in both World War I and World War II.


The University of Florida traces its origins to 1853, when the East Florida Seminary, the oldest of the University of Florida's four predecessor institutions, was founded in Ocala, Florida.
On January 6, 1853, Governor Thomas Brown signed a bill that provided public support for higher education in the state of Florida.[18] Gilbert Kingsbury was the first person to take advantage of the legislation, and established the East Florida Seminary, which operated until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. The East Florida Seminary was the first state-supported institution of higher learning in Florida.[19]
James Henry Roper, an educator from North Carolina and a state senator from Alachua County, had opened a school in Gainesville, the Gainesville Academy, in 1858. In 1866,[20] Roper offered his land and school to the State of Florida in exchange for the relocation of the East Florida Seminary to Gainesville.[21]
The second major precursor to the University of Florida was the Florida Agricultural College, established at Lake City by Jordan Probst in 1884. Florida Agricultural College became the state's first land-grant college under the Morrill Act. In 1903, the Florida Legislature, desiring to expand the school's outlook and curriculum beyond its agricultural and engineering origins, changed the name of Florida Agricultural College to the "University of Florida," a name that the school would hold for only two years.[22]
"University of the State of Florida"[edit]
In 1905, the Florida Legislature passed the Buckman Act, which consolidated the existing publicly supported higher education institutions of the state. The member of the legislature who wrote the act, Henry Holland Buckman, later became the namesake of Buckman Hall, one of the university's oldest buildings.[23] The Buckman Act organized the State University System of Florida and created the Florida Board of Control to govern the system. The act abolished the six pre-existing state-supported institutions of higher education, and consolidated the assets and academic programs of four of them to form the new "University of the State of Florida." The four predecessor institutions consolidated to form the new university included the University of Florida at Lake City (formerly Florida Agricultural College) in Lake City, the East Florida Seminary in Gainesville, the St. Petersburg Normal and Industrial School in St. Petersburg, and the South Florida Military College in Bartow.[24]
The Buckman Act also consolidated the colleges and schools into three institutions segregated by race and gender—the University of the State of Florida for white men, the Florida Female College for white women, and the State Normal School for Colored Students for African-American men and women.[25]
The City of Gainesville, led by its Mayor William Reuben Thomas, campaigned to be home to the new university.[26] On July 6, 1905, the Board of Control selected Gainesville for the new university campus. Andrew Sledd, president of the pre-existing University of Florida at Lake City, was selected to be the first president of the new University of the State of Florida. The 1905-1906 academic year was a year of transition; the new University of the State of Florida was legally created, but operated on the campus of the old University of Florida in Lake City until the first buildings on the new campus in Gainesville were completed. Architect William A. Edwards designed the first official campus buildings in the Collegiate Gothic style. Classes began on the new Gainesville campus on September 26, 1906, with 102 students enrolled.
In 1909, the name of the school was officially simplified from the "University of the State of Florida" to the "University of Florida."
The alligator was incidentally chosen as the school mascot in 1911, after a local vendor ordered and sold school pennants with an alligator emblem imprinted on them. The school colors, orange and blue, are believed to be derived from the blue and white school colors of the Florida Agricultural College in Lake City and the orange and black colors of the East Florida Seminary at Gainesville.[27]

College reorganization[edit]
In 1909, Albert Murphree was appointed the second president of the university, and organized several of the colleges of the university, increased enrollment from under 200 to over 2,000, and he was instrumental in the founding of the Florida Blue Key leadership society. Murphree is the only University of Florida president honored with a statue on the campus.

In 1924, the Florida Legislature mandated that women of a "mature age" (at least twenty-one years old) who had completed sixty semester hours from a "reputable educational institution" would be allowed to enroll during regular semesters at the University of Florida in programs that were unavailable at Florida State College for Women. Before this, only the summer semester was coeducational, to accommodate women teachers who wanted to further their education during the summer break.[28] Lassie Goodbread-Black from Lake City became the first woman to enroll at the University of Florida, in the College of Agriculture in 1925.[29]
John J. Tigert became the third university president in 1928. Disgusted by the under-the-table payments being made by universities to athletes, Tigert established the grant-in-aid athletic scholarship program in the early 1930s, which was the genesis of the modern athletic scholarship plan that is currently used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association.[30]
Post World War II[edit]
Beginning in 1946, there was dramatically increased interest among male applicants who wanted to attend the University of Florida, mostly returning World War II veterans who could attend college under the GI Bill of Rights (Servicemen's Readjustment Act). Unable to immediately accommodate this increased demand, the Florida Board of Control opened the Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida on the campus of Florida State College for Women in Tallahassee.[31] By the end of the 1946–47 school year, 954 men were enrolled at the Tallahassee Branch. The following semester, the Florida Legislature returned the Florida State College for Women to coeducational status and renamed it Florida State University. This sequence of events also opened up all of the colleges that comprise the University of Florida to female students. African-American students were allowed to enroll starting in 1958.[32] Shands Hospital first opened in 1958 along with the University of Florida College of Medicine to join the already established College of Pharmacy. Rapid campus expansion began in the 1950s and continues to the present day.[33]
The University of Florida is one of two Florida public universities, along with Florida State University, to be designated as a "preeminent university" by Florida senate bill 1076, enacted by the Florida legislature and signed into law by the governor in 2013.[34] As a result of this legislation, the preeminent universities now receive additional funding that is intended to improve the academics and national reputation of higher education within the state of Florida.[35]
National and international prominence[edit]
In 1985, the University of Florida was invited to become a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization composed of sixty-two academically prominent public and private research universities in the United States and Canada. Florida is one of the seventeen public, land-grant universities that belong to the AAU. In 2009, President Bernie Machen and the University of Florida Board of Trustees announced a major policy transition for the university. The Board of Trustees supported the reduction in the number of undergraduates and the shift of financial and other academic resources to graduate education and research in the future.[36]
Academics[edit]
Tuition[edit]
For the 2014-2015 academic year, tuition costs were:

Undergraduate&#160;
$210.43 per credit hour for in-state students, and $953.00 per credit hour for out-of-state students; Tuition fror online courses is lower; for graduate courses, higher.[37]

In 2015, Washington Monthly ranked the University of Florida 22nd among national universities, with criteria based on research, community service, and social mobility.[71] The lowest national ranking received by the university from a major publication comes from Forbes which ranked the university 87th in the nation in July 2015.[72] This ranking focuses mainly on net positive financial impact, in contrast to other rankings, and generally ranks liberal arts colleges above most research universities.[73]
In 2013, Florida Governor Rick Scott publicly announced his support for the University of Florida to ascend into the top ten among public universities, as measured by U.S. News &amp; World Report.[74] He called for additional funding to decrease the student-faculty ratio at the university.
Florida was ranked 14th in The Princeton Review's 2015 list of top party schools.[75] It also was named the number one vegan-friendly school for 2014, according to a survey conducted by PETA.[76]
Colleges and academic divisions[edit]
The University of Florida is divided into 16 colleges and more than 150 research, service and education centers, bureaus and institutes, offering more than 100 undergraduate majors and 200 graduate degrees.[77][78]

For the Class of 2016 (enrolled fall 2012), Florida received 27,419 applications and accepted 12,092 (44.1%).[81] The number enrolling was 6,289; the yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) was 52.0 percent.[81] In terms of class rank, 77% of enrolled freshmen were in the top 10 percent of their high school classes; 98 percent ranked in the top quarter.[81] The middle 50% range of SAT scores were 580 to 670 for critical reading, 590 to 690 for math, and 570 to 670 for writing. The middle 50% ACT Composite score range was 26 to 31.[81]
For fall 2014, the middle 50 percent of admitted freshman applicants had high school GPAs of 4.1 to 4.5, SAT scores of 1810 to 2060, and ACT scores of 27 to 31.[82]
Ending early decision[edit]
In 2007, the University of Florida joined the University of Virginia, Harvard University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Princeton University when they announced that they were discontinuing their early decision admissions in an effort to help foster economic diversity in their student bodies.[83] These universities assert that early decision admissions forces students to accept an offer of admission before evaluating the financial aid offers from multiple universities. The university's single application deadline is November 1.[84]
Honors program[edit]




The Honors Residential College at Hume Hall provides residential and classroom facilities for students in the Honors Program.


The University of Florida has an honors program;[85] After gaining acceptance to the university, students must apply separately to the Honors Program and demonstrate significant academic achievement to be accepted. There are over 100 courses offered exclusively to students in this program.[86] In 2011, more than 1900 students applied for 700 available seats. The Honors Program also offers housing for freshman in the Honors Residential College at Hume Hall. The program also offers special scholarships, internships, research, and study abroad opportunities.[87][88]
Scholarships[edit]
The Lombardi Scholars Program, created in 2002 and named in honor of the university's ninth president John V. Lombardi, is a merit scholarship for Florida students. The scholarship offers $2,700 a semester for a total of eight to ten semesters.[89][90]
The J. Wayne Reitz Scholars Program, created in 1997 and named in honor of the university's fifth president J. Wayne Reitz, is a leadership and merit-based scholarship for Florida students. The scholarship offers a yearly $2,500 stipend that may be renewed for up to three years.[91][92]
Sustainability[edit]




Opened in 2003, Rinker Hall was the first building on campus to receive LEED recognition. Since opening, other new and renovated buildings on campus have also received certification.


In 2005, the University of Florida became a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary for environmental and wildlife management, resource conservation, environmental education, waste management, and outreach.[93]
Through long-term environmental initiatives, the University of Florida created an Office of Sustainability in 2006.[94] Their mission is to continue to improve environmental sustainability in many different areas on campus. They have stated that their future goals are to produce zero waste by 2015, and to achieve Carbon Neutrality by 2025.[94] Recently the university appointed a new sustainability director. Florida received a "B+" grade on the 2009 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.[95] In 2009 "B+" was the second highest grade awarded by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.
Satellite facilities[edit]
The university also maintains a number of facilities apart from its main campus. The J. Hillis Miller Health Science Center also has a teaching hospital located at UF Health at Jacksonville, which serves as the Jacksonville campus for the University's College of Medicine, College of Nursing, and College of Pharmacy.[96] A number of residencies are also offered at this facility.[96] The University's College of Pharmacy also maintains campuses in Orlando, Jacksonville, and St. Petersburg.[97] The College of Dentistry maintains clinics in Hialeah, Naples, and St. Petersburg.[98]
The university's Warrington College of Business established programs in South Florida in 2004, and recently built a 6,100-square-foot (570&#160;m2) facility in Sunrise, Florida.[99] The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences has extensions in each of the 67 counties in Florida, and 13 research and education centers with a total of 19 locations throughout the state.[100] In 2005, the university established the Beijing Center for International Studies in Beijing that offers research facilities, offices, and degree opportunities.[101]
Research[edit]

The University of Florida Cancer and Genetics Research Complex is one of several research facilities at the university


The University of Florida is one of the largest research universities in the nation. According to a 2011 study by the university's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, the university contributed $8.76 billion to Florida's economy and was responsible for over 100,000 jobs in the 2009–10 fiscal year.[102] The Milken Institute named Florida one of the top-five U.S. institutions in the transfer of biotechnology research to the marketplace (2006).[103] Some 50 biotechnology companies have resulted from faculty research programs. Florida consistently ranks among the top 10 universities in licensing.[104] Royalty and licensing income includes the glaucoma drug Trusopt, the sports drink Gatorade, and the Sentricon termite elimination system. The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences is ranked No. 1 by the NSF in Research and Development.[105] Florida ranked seventh among all private and public universities for the total number of patents awarded for 2005.[104]
The University of Florida was awarded $678 million in total research expenditures, more than all the other Florida universities combined, in sponsored research in 2009-10.[106] Research includes diverse areas such as health-care and citrus production (the world's largest citrus research center). In 2002, Florida began leading six other universities under a $15 million NASA grant to work on a variety of space-related research during a five-year period.[107] The university has a partnership with Spain that helped to create the world's largest single-aperture optical telescope in the Canary Islands (the total cost was $93 million).[104] Plans are also under way for the University of Florida to construct a new 50,000-square-foot (4,600&#160;m2) research facility in collaboration with the Burnham Institute for Medical Research that will ultimately be located in the center of University of Central Florida's Health Sciences Campus in Orlando, Florida.[108] Research will include the areas of diabetes, aging, genetics and cancer.
The University of Florida has made great strides in the space sciences over the last decade.[109] The Astronomy Department's focus on the development of image-detection devices has led to increases in funding, telescope time, and significant scholarly achievements. Faculty members in organic chemistry have made notable discoveries in astrobiology, while faculty members in physics have participated actively in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory project, the largest and most ambitious project ever funded by the NSF.[109] Through the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, the University of Florida is the lead institution on the NASA University Research, Engineering, and Technology Institute (URETI) for Future Space Transport project to develop the next generation space shuttle.[110] In addition, the university also performs diabetes research in a statewide screening program that has been sponsored by a $10 million grant from the American Diabetes Association.[111] The University of Florida also houses one of the world's leading lightning research teams.[104] University scientists have started up a biofuels pilot plant that has been specifically designed to test ethanol-producing technology.[104] The university is also host to a nuclear research reactor which is known for its Neutron Activation Analysis Laboratory.[112] In addition, the University of Florida is the first American university to receive a European Union grant to house a Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence.[113]
The University of Florida has more than $750 million in new research facilities recently completed or under construction, including the Nanoscale Research Facility, the Pathogens Research Facility and the Biomedical Sciences Building.[citation needed] Additionally, Innovation Square, a 24/7 live/work/play research environment being developed along Southwest Second Avenue between the University of Florida campus and downtown Gainesville, recently broke ground and plans to open next fall. The university's Office of Technology Licensing will relocate to Innovation Square, joining Florida Innovation Hub, a business "super-incubator designed to promote the development of new high-tech companies based on the university's research progtrams. Innovation Square also will include retail space, restaurants and local businesses, as well as residential space for people to live.[114]

Florida has more lightning than any other U.S. state.[115] Where does lightning strike most often in the U.S.? Retrieved November 17, 2015. The University of Florida sponsors the International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT), a lightning research facility run by university faculty and research employees at the Camp Blanding Army National Guard Base.[116] The ICLRT Center occupies over 100 acres (40 ha) at Camp Blanding, located about 25 miles (45&#160;km) north-east of Gainesville, Florida. One of their primary research tools is lightning initiation from overhead thunderclouds using the triggered lightning rocket-and-wire technique. Small sounding rockets connected to long copper wires are fired into likely lightning storm cumulonimbus clouds. When the rocket or its wire is struck by lightning, the passing of the high-voltage lightning strike down the wire vaporizes it as the lightning travels to the ground. Undergraduate and graduate research in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering's Lightning Research Group is used to increase new fundamental knowledge about lightning-based phenomena.

Student government[edit]




Seal for the UF Student Government


The University of Florida Student Government is the governing body of students who attend the University of Florida, representing the university's nearly 50,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students. The university's student government currently operates on a yearly $18.7 million budget, one of the largest student government budgets in the United States, and the money is allocated by the Budget Committee of the Student Senate.[150]
The student government was established in 1909 and consists of executive, judicial and unicameral legislative branches. The executive branch includes the student government president, vice president and treasurer elected by the student body during the spring semester, as well as nine agencies and forty-one cabinet members.
The Student Senate is the legislative branch, and is composed of 100 senators who serve one-year terms. The student body elects fifty senators during each spring semester and the remaining fifty during the fall semester. The senators elect a Senate President and Senate President Pro Tempore twice a year, after each semester's elections, to lead the Student Senate. During student government elections students may also vote on referendums, such as the renewable energy referendum,[151] which was approved by 78% of voting students in the spring of 2007. This referendum proposed a fifty-cents-per-credit-hour increase to student activity fees to fund renewable energy and efficiency on campus.
The student government judicial branch has two major components: the Supreme Court of the Student Body (headed by a Chief Justice) and all elections related officials (the Supervisor of Elections and the Elections Commission). The Supreme Court consists of seven second or third-year law students nominated by the Student Body President and confirmed by the Student Senate. Each justice serves a "life-time" term, which extends through the individual justice's graduation and insulates the court from the politics of student government. The Chief Justice may appoint a marshal and clerk. The election commission is also composed of law students and it adjudicates all student government election complaints. The commission has six members, one of whom also serves as the commission chairman.
The student government executive branch is led by the Student Body President and includes the Student Body Vice President, Student Body Treasurer, twelve agencies, twelve executive secretaries, nineteen cabinet directors, and three cabinet chairs.
