Research[edit]
Giles has been associated with the computer science or electrical engineering departments at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, the University of Pisa, the University of Trento and the University of Maryland, College Park. Previous positions were at NEC Research Institute (now NEC Labs), Princeton, NJ; Air Force Research Laboratory; and the United States Naval Research Laboratory. He is best known for his work on the creation of novel scientific and academic search engines and digital libraries and is considered by some one of the fathers of academic document search. Earlier research was concerned with recurrent neural networks and optical computing.
His research interests are in intelligent web and cyberinfrastructure tools, search engines and information retrieval, digital libraries, web services, knowledge and information management and extraction, machine learning, and information and data mining. He has created several vertical search engines in these areas. He has over 300 publications with some in Nature, Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. His research is well cited with an h-index of 78 according to Google Scholar and nearly 27,000 total citations as evidenced in CiteSeerX, ISI and Google Scholar.
Awards[edit]
Giles is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM),[3] IEEE[4] and International Neural Networks Society, INNS. He recently received the Gabor Award[5] which recognizes achievement in engineering/application from the INNS . He twice received the IBM Distinguished Faculty Award.
Neural networks[edit]
Giles' work on neural networks showed that fundamental computational structures such as regular grammars and finite state machines could be theoretically represented in recurrent neural networks. Some of these publications are cited as early work in "deep" learning.
CiteSeer and search engines[edit]
In 1998 and 1999 his work published in Science and Nature with Steve Lawrence estimated the size of the web and showed that search engines did not index that much of it. This work also showed that the web had significantly matured and had a diversity of material and resources.
With Steve Lawrence and Kurt Bollacker, Giles was responsible for the creation in 1997 of automatic citation indexing and CiteSeer, a public academic search engine and digital library for Computer and Information Science. Under his direction CiteSeer was moved to and is being maintained at the Pennsylvania State University. CiteSeer has been replaced by the Next Generation CiteSeer, CiteSeerX.
He is the director of the Next Generation CiteSeer project, CiteSeerX, also at the Pennsylvania State University. In addition, he was responsible for the creation of an academic business search engine and digital library, BizSeer (previously known as SmealSearch). With Isaac Councill, he created automatic acknowledgement indexing, permitting for the first time the automatic search and indexing of acknowledged entities in scholarly and research documents. The search engine for this was AckSeer. He also was the cocreater of the first search engine for robots.txt, BotSeer.
His recent research in collaboration with Professors Prasenjit Mitra, Karl Mueller, Barbara Garrison and James Kubicki has resulted in the development of a search engine and data portal for chemistry, ChemxSeer, ChemXSeer. With Yang Sun, a novel search engine, BotSeer, was designed that searches and indexes robots.txt files on web sites. The Next Generation CiteSeer, CiteSeerx, came online in February 2008, with over one million articles indexed and now with active crawling exceeds 5 million articles. RefSeerX is a context-aware citation recommendation service which recommends papers from the CiteSeerX that are most relevant to a given text. These new services are based on SeerSuite, a package of open sources tools for searching and indexing academic documents and data.
