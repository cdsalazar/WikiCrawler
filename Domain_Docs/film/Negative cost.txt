				Negative cost is the net expense to produce and shoot a film, excluding such expenditures as distribution and promotion.[1]
Low-budget movies, for example The Blair Witch Project, can have promotional expenses that are much larger than the negative cost.[2]
The term comes from the costs up to the production of the final negative.
