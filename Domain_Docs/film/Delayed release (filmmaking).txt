				A delayed release or late release in the film industry refers to the relatively late release of a film to the public. A release can be postponed due to the sometimes difficult transition of the production and/or post-production to the sales and distribution phase of the film production cycle. Due to several factors a film release can be delayed:

Problems during post-production of an artistic nature.
Political problems regarding the film.
Economical problems relating to limitations in the film budget.

These problems can be resolved by overcoming artistic problems, making politically correct or commercially successful changes to the film and/or relieving budgetary problems.
