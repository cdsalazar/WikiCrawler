				A traditional production board or production strip board is a filmmaking term for a cardboard or wooden chart holding colour-coded strips of paper, each containing information about a scene in the script. The strips can then be rearranged and laid out sequentially to represent the order one wants to film in (most films are shot "out of sequence," meaning that filming does not begin with scene 1 and end with the last scene). This produces a schedule that the producers can use to plan the production.
A modern version of a strip board will almost certainly be printed using dedicated computer software, such as the industry standards EP Scheduling or MovieMagic Scheduling, or by customizing general purpose software such as OpenOffice.org Calc or Microsoft Excel.
