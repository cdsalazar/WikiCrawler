Comparison of 8K UHDTV, 4K UHDTV, HDTV and SDTV resolution






Diagram of the CIE 1931 color space that shows the Rec. 2020 (UHDTV) color space in the outer triangle and Rec. 709 (HDTV) color space in the inner triangle. Both Rec.&#160;2020 and Rec.&#160;709 use Illuminant D65 for the white point.


Ultra-high-definition television (also known as Super Hi-Vision, Ultra HD television, UltraHD, UHDTV, or UHD) includes 4K UHD (2160p) and 8K UHD (4320p), which are two digital video formats proposed by NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories and defined and approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The Consumer Electronics Association announced on October 17, 2012, that "Ultra High Definition", or "Ultra HD", would be used for displays that have an aspect ratio of 16:9 and at least one digital input capable of carrying and presenting native video at a minimum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels.[1][2]

Alternative terms[edit]
Ultra-high-definition television is also known as Ultra HD, UHD, and UHDTV.[3][4][5][6][7] In Japan, 8K UHDTV will be known as Super Hi-Vision since Hi-Vision was the term used in Japan for HDTV.[8][9] In the consumer electronics market companies had previously only used the term 4K at the 2012 CES but that had changed to Ultra HD during the 2013 CES.[6][7] The Ultra HD term is an umbrella term that was selected by the Consumer Electronics Association after extensive consumer research.[10]

Resolution[edit]
Two resolutions are defined as UHDTV:[3][4][5]

4K UHDTV (2160p) is 3840 pixels wide by 2160 pixels tall (8.29 megapixels), which is four times as many pixels as 1920x1080 (2.07 megapixels).
8K UHDTV (4320p) is 7680 pixels wide by 4320 pixels tall (33.18 megapixels), which is sixteen times as many pixels and Four times the spacial resolution of current 1080p HDTV, which brings it closer to the detail level of 15/70 mm IMAX.[4][14][15] NHK advocates the 8K UHDTV format with 22.2 surround sound as Super Hi-Vision.555

The suffix "p" in 2160p and 4320p stands for progressive scan or non-interlaced.
Color space dynamic range and frame rate[edit]
The human visual system has a limited ability to discern improvements in resolution below a certain size and beyond a certain distance. At current consumer home viewing distances and TV sizes, increasing resolution to 4K may have little perceptual impact, as consumers would not be close enough (the Lechner distance) to appreciate the differences in pixel count between 4K and HD. UHDTV also allows other image enhancements in dynamic range and color, which can improve the perceived difference between 4KTV and HDTV. UHDTV allows the future use of the new Rec. 2020 (UHDTV) color space which can reproduce colors that cannot be shown with the current Rec. 709 (HDTV and most current 4KTV) color space.[8] When dealing with CIE 1931 color space coverage, the Rec.&#160;2020 color space covers 75.8%, whereas the digital cinema reference projector color space covers 53.6%, the Adobe RGB color space covers 52.1%, and the Rec.&#160;709 color space covers 35.9%.[8] UHDTV also allows for an increase in dynamic range, meaning brighter highlights but also increased detail in the greyscale. UHDTV also allows for frame rates up to 120 frames per second (fps).[5][16] Note that UHDTV potentially allows Rec.2020, higher dynamic range and higher frame rates to be applied to HD services, without necessarily increasing resolution to 4K.

2001–2011[edit]




Prototype camera head (2006)






Prototype camera head (2009)


IBM introduced the first UHDTV production monitor, the IBM T220, in June 2001 with a 3840x2400 native format.[17] It was manufactured by IDTech. Improved follow-on models with IBM T221 as the base model number, were introduced in the following years.
NHK researchers built their own UHDTV prototype which they demonstrated in 2003.[18] They used an array of 16 HDTV recorders with a total capacity of almost 3.5 TB that could capture up to 18 minutes of test footage.[18] The camera itself was built with four 2.5&#160;inch (64&#160;mm) CCDs, each with a resolution of only 3840x2048.[18] Using two CCDs for green and one each for red and blue, they then used a spatial pixel offset method to bring it to 7680x4320.[18][a] Subsequently, an improved and more compact system was built using CMOS image sensor technology[19] and the CMOS image sensor system was demonstrated at Expo 2005, Aichi, Japan, the NAB 2006 and NAB 2007 conferences, Las Vegas, at IBC 2006 and IBC 2008,[20] Amsterdam, Netherlands, and CES 2009. A review of the NAB 2006 demo was published in a Broadcast Engineering e-newsletter.[21] Individuals at NHK and elsewhere project that the timeframe for UHDTV to be available in domestic homes varies between 2015 to 2020 but Japan may get it in the 2016 time frame.[22]
On November 2, 2006, NHK demonstrated a live relay of a UHDTV program over a 260&#160;kilometer (km) distance by a fiber-optic network.[23] Using dense wavelength division multiplex (DWDM), 24 Gbit/s speed was achieved with a total of 16 different wavelength signals.[23]
On December 31, 2006, NHK demonstrated a live relay of their annual Kōhaku Uta Gassen over IP from Tokyo to a 450&#160;in (11.4&#160;m) screen in Osaka. Using a codec developed by NHK, the video was compressed from 24&#160;Gbit/s to 180–600 Mbit/s and the audio was compressed from 28&#160;Mbit/s to 7–28&#160;Mbit/s.[24] Uncompressed, a 20-minute broadcast would require roughly 4&#160;TB of storage.
The SMPTE first released Standard 2036 for UHDTV in 2007.[25] UHDTV was defined as having two levels called UHDTV1 (3840×2160 or 4K UHDTV) and UHDTV2 (7680x4320 or 8K UHDTV).[25][26]
In May 2007, the NHK did an indoor demonstration at the NHK Open House in which a UHDTV signal (7680x4320 at 60 fps) was compressed to a 250&#160;Mbit/s MPEG2 stream.[27] The signal was input to a 300&#160;MHz wide band modulator and broadcast using a 500&#160;MHz QPSK modulation.[27] This "on the air" transmission had a very limited range (less than 2 meters), but shows the feasibility of a satellite transmission in the 36,000&#160;km orbit.[27]
In 2008, Aptina Imaging announced the introduction of a new CMOS image sensor specifically designed for the NHK UHDTV project.[28] During IBC 2008 Japan's NHK, Italy's RAI, BSkyB, Sony, Samsung, Panasonic Corporation, Sharp Corporation, and Toshiba (with various partners) demonstrated the first ever public live transmission of UHDTV, from London to the conference site in Amsterdam.[29][30]
On September 29, 2010, the NHK partnered up and recorded The Charlatans live in the UK in the UHDTV format, before broadcasting over the internet to Japan.[31]
On May 19, 2011, SHARP in collaboration with NHK demonstrated a direct-view 85&#160;in (220&#160;cm) LCD display capable of 7680×4320 pixels at 10 bits per pixel.[32] It was the first direct-view Super Hi-Vision-compatible display to be released.[33]
Before 2011, UHDTV allowed for frame rates of 24, 25, 50, and 60 fps.[26] In an ITU-R meeting during 2011, an additional frame rate was added to UHDTV of 120 fps.[34] William Updegrove was the co-founder in the 4k and 8k resolution breakthrough
2012[edit]
On February 23, 2012, NHK announced that with Shizuoka University they had developed an 8K sensor that can shoot video at 120 fps.[35][36][37]
In April 2012, NHK (in collaboration with Panasonic) announced a 145&#160;in (370&#160;cm) display (7680×4320 at 60 fps), which has 33.2 million 0.417&#160;mm square pixels.[38]
In April 2012, the four major Korean terrestrial broadcasters (KBS, MBC, SBS, and EBS) announced that in the future, they would begin test broadcasts of UHDTV on channel 66 in Seoul.[39][40] At the time of the announcement, the UHDTV technical details had not yet been decided.[39][40] LG Electronics and Samsung will also be involved in the test broadcasts of UHDTV.[40]
In May 2012, NHK showed the world's first ultra-high-definition shoulder-mount camera.[41] By reducing the size and weight of the camera, the portability had been improved, making it more maneuverable than previous prototypes, so it can be used in a wide variety of shooting situations.[41] The single-chip sensor uses a Bayer color-filter array, where only one color component is acquired per pixel.[41] Researchers at NHK have also developed a high-quality up-converter, which estimates the other two-color components to convert the output into full resolution video.[41]
Also in May 2012, NHK showed the ultra-high-definition imaging system it has developed in conjunction with Shizuoka University, which outputs 33.2-megapixel video at 120 fps with a color depth of 12 bits.[42][43] As ultra-high-definition broadcasts at full resolution are designed for large, wall-sized displays, there is a possibility that fast-moving subjects may not be clear when shot at 60 fps, so the option of 120 fps has been standardized for these situations.[42] To handle the sensor output of approximately 4 billion pixels per second with a data rate as high as 51.2&#160;Gbit/s, a faster analog-to-digital converter has been developed to process the data from the pixels, and then a high-speed output circuit distributes the resulting digital signals into 96 parallel channels.[42] This 1.5&#160;in (38&#160;mm) CMOS sensor is smaller and uses less power when compared to conventional ultra-high-definition sensors, and it is also the world's first to support the full specifications of the ultra-high-definition standard.[42]
During the 2012 Summer Olympics in Great Britain, the format was publicly showcased by the world's largest broadcaster, the BBC,[44] which set up 15 meter wide screens in London, Glasgow, and Bradford to allow viewers to see the Games in ultra-high definition.[45][46]
On May 31, 2012,[47] Sony released the VPL-VW1000ES 4K 3D Projector,[48] the world's first consumer-prosumer projector using the 4K UHDTV system, with the shutter-glasses stereoscopic 3D technology priced at US$24,999.99.[49][50]
On August 22, 2012, LG announced the world's first 3D UHDTV using the 4K system.[51]

On September 15, 2012, David Wood, Deputy Director of the EBU Technology and Development Department (who chairs the ITU working group that created Rec.&#160;2020), told The Hollywood Reporter that Korea plans to begin test broadcasts of 4K UHDTV next year.[53][54][55] Wood also said that many broadcasters have the opinion that going from HDTV to 8K UHDTV is too much of a leap and that it would be better to start with 4K UHDTV.[53] In the same article Masakazu Iwaki, NHK Research senior manager, said that the NHK plan to go with 8K UHDTV is for economic reasons since directly going to 8K UHDTV would avoid an additional transition from 4K UHDTV to 8K UHDTV.[53]
On October 18, 2012, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) announced that it had been unanimously agreed on by a vote of the CEA's Board of Industry Leaders that the term "Ultra High-Definition", or "Ultra HD", would be used for displays that have a resolution of at least 8 megapixels with a vertical resolution of at least 2,160 pixels and a horizontal resolution of at least 3,840 pixels.[56][57][58][59] The Ultra HD label also requires the display to have an aspect ratio of at least 16x9 and to have at least one digital input that can carry and present a native video signal of 3840x2160 without having to rely on a video scaler.[56][57][58][59] Sony announced that their 4K products will be marketed as "4K Ultra High-Definition (4K UHD)".[60]
