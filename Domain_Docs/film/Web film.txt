				A web film is a film made with the medium of the Internet and its distribution constraints in mind.[1] This term aims to differentiate content made for the Internet from content made for other media, such as cinema or television, that has been converted into a World Wide Web-compatible format. Web films are a form of new media.
Forms[edit]
There are broadly three forms of films that can be encountered on the Internet:
