Help
Wikipedia












Read or find an article
The Readers' FAQ and our about page contain the most commonly sought information about Wikipedia.
There is a search box in the upper-right corner of every page with the word "Search" in it. Just type what you are looking for in there and then press â†µ Enter. See Help:Searching for more details.
There are other ways to browse and explore Wikipedia articles; many can be found at Portal:Contents. Also see our disclaimer for cautions about Wikipedia's limitations.





Edit an article
Contributing is easy: see how to edit a page or contributing to Wikipedia. For a quick summary on participating, see the plain and simple guide. You can practice editing and experiment in a sandbox. Or play the Wikipedia Adventure to learn to edit in an hour. The Cheatsheet can remind you of basic wiki markup.
Be&#160;bold in improving articles! When adding facts, please provide references so others may verify them. If you are affiliated with the article subject, please see our conflict of interest guideline.
If you're looking for places you can help out, the community portal is the place to go.







Report a problem with an article
If there is a problem with an article about yourself, a family member, a friend or a colleague, please read Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Help and, if necessary, add a discussion to the biographies of living persons noticeboard.
If you spot a problem with an article, you can fix it directly, by clicking on the "Edit" link at the beginning of that page. See the "I want to edit an article" section of this page for more information.
If you don't feel ready to fix the article yourself, please post a message on the article's talk page. This will bring the matter to the attention of others who work on that article. There is a "Talk" link at the beginning of every article page.
Alternatively you can contact us. If it's an article about you or your organization, see Contact us - Subjects.





Create a new article or upload media
Check Your first article to see if your topic is appropriate, then the Article wizard will walk you through creating the article.
Once you have created an article, see Writing better articles for guidance on how to improve it and what to include (like reference citations).
For contributing images, audio or video files, see the Introduction to uploading images. Then the Upload wizard will guide you through that process.







Factual questions
If searching Wikipedia has not answered your question (for example, questions like "Which country has the world's largest fishing fleet?"), try the Reference Desk. Volunteers there will attempt to answer your questions on any topic, or point you towards the information you need.





Stuck?

For your convenience, answers have been recorded for the most frequently asked questions.
You can find also where to ask questions or make comments.
You can ask questions about using Wikipedia at the Help desk or at the Teahouse. Volunteers will respond as soon as possible.
Or ask for help on your talk page and a volunteer will visit you there!
You can get live help with editing in the help chatroom.

Tip of the day
Making the editbox more visually pleasing
Do you know the GFDL License inside-out, and have thousands of edits to your credit? Are all those copyright disclaimer warnings starting to bug you? Add this to your vector.css (or whatever skin you are using):



/* Remove to-me-useless notes in all edit boxes. leaves only the command buttons and special chars. */
#editpage-copywarn { display: none; }
#editpage-copywarn1 { display: none; }
#editpage-copywarn2 { display: none; }
#editpage-copywarn3 { display: none; }
