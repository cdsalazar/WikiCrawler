Traffic lights display green to indicate "go ahead".


To green-light is to give permission or a go ahead to move forward with a project.[1] The term is a reference to the green traffic signal, indicating "go ahead". In the context of the film and television industries, to green-light something is to formally approve its production finance and to commit to this financing, thereby allowing the project to move forward from the development phase to pre-production and principal photography.
The power to green-light a project is generally reserved to those in a project or financial management role within an organization. The process of taking a project from pitch to green-light formed the basis of a successful reality TV show titled Project Greenlight.[2]
At the Big Six major film studios in the United States and the mini-majors, green-light power is generally exercised by committees of the studios' high-level executives.[3] However, the studio president, chairman, or chief executive is usually the person who makes the final judgment call.[3] For the largest film budgets involving several hundred million U.S. dollars, the chief executive officer or chief operating officer of the studio's parent conglomerate may hold final green-light authority.[3]
