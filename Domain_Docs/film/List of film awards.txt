				Main article: List of prizes, medals and awards
This is a list of groups, organizations and festivals that recognize achievements in cinema, usually by awarding various prizes. The awards sometimes also have popular unofficial names (such as the 'Oscar' for Hollywood's Academy Awards), which are mentioned if applicable. Many awards are simply identified by the name of the group presenting the award.
Awards have been divided into four major categories: Critics' Awards, voted on (usually annually) by a group of critics; Festival Awards, awards presented to the best film shown in a particular film festival; Industry Awards, which are selected by professionals working in some branch of the movie industry; and Audience Awards, which are voted by the general public.
