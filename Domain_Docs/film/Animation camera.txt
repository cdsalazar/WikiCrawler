An animation camera manufactured by Crass, Berlin, in 1957.


An animation camera, a type of rostrum camera, is a movie camera specially adapted for frame-by-frame shooting animation or stop motion. It consists of a camera body with lens and film magazines, a stand that allows the camera to be raised and lowered, and a table, often with both top and underneath lighting. The artwork to be photographed is placed on this table.
Since most animation is now produced digitally, new animation cameras are not widely manufactured. Image scanners, video cameras and digital SLRs have taken their place.
