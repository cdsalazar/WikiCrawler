Geʻez (/ˈɡiːɛz/;[6][7] ግዕዝ, Gəʿəz [ɡɨʕɨz]; also transliterated Giʻiz, also referred to by some as "Ethiopic") is an ancient South Semitic language that originated in the northern region of Ethiopia and Eritrea in the Horn of Africa. It later became the official language of the Kingdom of Aksum and Ethiopian imperial court.
Today, Geʻez remains only as the main language used in the liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Catholic Church, and the Beta Israel Jewish community. However, in Ethiopia Amharic (the main lingua franca of modern Ethiopia) or other local languages, and in Eritrea and Tigray Region in Ethiopia, Tigrigna may be used for sermons. Tigrigna and Tigre are closely related to Geʻez with at least four different configurations proposed.[8] Some linguists do not believe that Geʻez constitutes the common ancestor of modern Ethiopian languages, but that Geʻez became a separate language early on from some hypothetical, completely unattested language,[9] and can thus be seen as an extinct sister language of Tigre and Tigrinya.[10] The foremost Ethiopian experts such as Amsalu Aklilu point to the vast proportion of inherited nouns that are unchanged, and even spelled identically in both Geʻez and Amharic (and to a lesser degree, Tigrinya).[11]

Because Geʻez is no longer a spoken language, the pronunciation of some consonants is not completely certain. Gragg (1997:244) writes "The consonants corresponding to the graphemes ś (Geʻez ሠ) and ḍ (Geʻez ፀ) have merged respectively with /s/ and /ṣ/ in the phonological system represented by the traditional pronunciation—and indeed in all modern Ethiopian Semitic. ... There is, however, no evidence either in the tradition or in Ethiopian Semitic [for] what value these consonants may have had in Geʻez."
A similar problem is found for the consonant transliterated ḫ. Gragg (1997:245) notes that it corresponds in etymology to velar or uvular fricatives in other Semitic languages, but it was pronounced exactly the same as ḥ in the traditional pronunciation. Though the use of a different letter shows that it must originally have had some other pronunciation, what that pronunciation was is not certain.
The chart below lists /ɬ/ and /ɬ'/ as possible values for Geʻez ሠ and Geʻez ፀ respectively. It also lists /χ/ as a possible value for ኀ. These values are tentative, but based on the Proto-Semitic consonants that they are descended from.
Phonemes of Geʻez[edit]
In the chart below, IPA values are shown. When transcription is different from the IPA, the character is shown in angular brackets. Question marks follow phonemes whose interpretation is controversial (as explained in the preceding section).

In Geʻez, Emphatic consonants are phonetically ejectives. As is the case with Arabic, emphatic velars may actually be phonetically uvular ([q] and [qʷ]).

Geʻez consonants in relation to Proto-Semitic[edit]
Geʻez consonants have a triple opposition between voiceless, voiced, and ejective (or emphatic) obstruents. The Proto-Semitic "emphasis" in Geʻez has been generalized to include emphatic p̣. Geʻez has phonologized labiovelars, descending from Proto-Semitic biphonemes. Geʻez ś ሠ Sawt (in Amharic, also called śe-nigūś, i.e. the se letter used for spelling the word nigūś "king") is reconstructed as descended from a Proto-Semitic voiceless lateral fricative [ɬ]. Like Arabic,[clarification needed] Geʻez merged Proto-Semitic š and s in ሰ (also called se-isat: the se letter used for spelling the word isāt "fire"). Apart from this, Geʻez phonology is comparably conservative; the only other Proto-Semitic phonological contrasts lost may be the interdental fricatives and ghayin.
Morphology[edit]
Nouns[edit]
Geʻez distinguishes two genders, masculine and feminine, which in certain words is marked with the suffix -t. These are less strongly distinguished than in other Semitic languages, in that many nouns not denoting persons can be used in either gender: in translated Christian texts there is a tendency for nouns to follow the gender of the noun with a corresponding meaning in Greek.[12]
There are two numbers, singular and plural. The plural can be constructed either by suffixing -āt to a word, or by internal plural.

Plural using suffix: ʿāmat – ʿāmatāt 'year(s)', māy – māyāt 'water(s)' (Note: In contrast to adjectives and other Semitic languages, the -āt suffix can be used for constructing the plural of both genders).
Internal plural: bet – ʾābyāt 'house, houses'; qərnəb – qarānəbt 'eyelid, eyelids'.

Nouns also have two cases, the nominative which is not marked and the accusative which is marked with final -a (e.g. bet, bet-a).
Internal plural[edit]
Internal plurals follow certain patterns. Triconsonantal nouns follow one of the following patterns.

Syntax[edit]
Noun phrases[edit]
Noun phrases have the following overall order:
(demonstratives) noun (adjective)-(relative clause)


ba-za:
hagar


in-this:f
city


in this city




nəguś
kəbur


king
glorious


the glorious king


Adjectives and determiners agree with the noun in gender and number:


za:ti
nəgəśt
kəbərt


this:fem
queen
glorious:fem


this glorious queen




'əllu
nagaśt
kəbura:n


these:mpl
kings
glorious:pl


these glorious kings


Relative clauses are introduced by a pronoun which agrees in gender and number with the preceding noun:


bə'si
za=qatal-əww-o
la=wald-o


man
which:masc=kill-3mp-3ms
to=son=3ms


the man whose son they killed


As in many Semitic languages, possession by a noun phrase is shown through the construct state. In Geʻez, this is formed by suffixing /-a/ to the possessed noun, which is followed by the possessor, as in the following examples (Lambdin 1978:23):


wald-a
nəguś


son-construct
king


the son of the king




səm-a
mal'ak


name-construct
angel


the name of the angel


Possession by a pronoun is indicated by a suffix on the possessed noun, as seen in the following table:


Possessor
affix


1sg 'my'
-əya


2msg 'your (masc)'
-əka


2fsg 'your (fem)'
-əki


3msg 'his'
-u


3fsg 'her'
-a:


1pl 'our'
-əna


2mpl 'your (masc. plur)'
-əkəma


2fpl 'your (fem. plur)'
-əkən


3mpl 'their (masc)'
-omu


3fpl 'their (fem)'
-on


The following examples show a few nouns with pronominal possessors:


səm-əya
səm-u


name-1sg
name-3sg


my name
his name


Another common way of indicating possession by a noun phrase combines the pronominal suffix on a noun with the possessor preceded by the preposition /la=/ 'to, for' (Lambdin 1978:44):


səm-u
la=neguś


name-3sg
to=king


'the king's name; the name of the king'


Lambdin (1978:45) notes that in comparison to the construct state, this kind of possession is only possible when the possessor is definite and specific. Lambdin also notes that the construct state is the unmarked form of possession in Geʻez.
Prepositional phrases[edit]
Geʻez is a prepositional language, as in the following example (Lambdin 1978:16):


wəsta
hagar


to
city


to the city


There are three special prepositions, /ba=/ 'in, with', /la=/ 'to, for', /'əm=/ 'from', which always appear as enclitics on the following noun, as in the following examples:


'əm=hagar


from=city


from the city




ba=hagar


in=city


in the city


These enclitic prepositions in Geʻez are similar to the inseparable prepositions in Hebrew.
Sentences[edit]
The normal word order for declarative sentences is VSO. Objects of verbs show accusative case marked with the suffix /-a/:


Takal-a
bə'si
ʕətsʼ-a


plant-3ms
man
tree-acc


The man planted a tree


Questions with a wh-word ('who', 'what', etc.) show the question word at the beginning of the sentence:


'Ayya
hagar
ḥanaṣ-u


which
city
flee-3pl


Which city did they flee?


Negation[edit]
The common way of negation is the prefix ʾi- which descends from ʾey- (which is attested in Axum inscriptions) from ʾay from Proto-Semitic *ʾal by palatalization.[2] It is prefixed to verbs as follows:


nəḥna
ʾi-nəkl
ḥawira


we
(we) cannot
go


we cannot go


Writing system[edit]
Main article: Ge'ez script




Genesis 29.11–16 in Geʻez


Geʻez is written with Ethiopic or the Geʻez abugida, a script that was originally developed specifically for this language. In languages that use it, such as Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called Fidäl, which means script or alphabet.
Geʻez is read from left to right.
The Geʻez script has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for Amharic in Ethiopia and Tigrinya in Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is also used for Sebatbeit, Meʻen, Agew and most other languages of Ethiopia. In Eritrea it is used for Tigre, and it is often used for Bilen, a Cushitic language. Some other languages in the Horn of Africa, such as Oromo, used to be written using Geʻez but have switched to Latin-based alphabets.
It also uses 4 symbols for labialized velar consonants, which are variants of the non-labialized velar consonants:

ቀ
ኀ

History and literature[edit]
Although it is often said that Geʻez literature is dominated by the Bible including the Deuterocanon, in fact there are many medieval and early modern original texts in the language. Most of its important works are also the literature of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which include Christian liturgy (service books, prayers, hymns), Lives of Saints, and Patristic literature. For instance, around 200 texts were written about indigenous Ethiopian saints from the fourteenth through the nineteenth century. This religious orientation of Geʻez literature was a result of traditional education being the responsibility of priests and monks. "The Church thus constituted the custodian of the nation's culture", notes Richard Pankhurst, and describes the traditional education as follows:

Traditional education was largely biblical. It began with the learning of the alphabet, or more properly, syllabary... The student's second grade comprised the memorization of the first chapter of the first Epistle General of St. John in Geez. The study of writing would probably also begin at this time, and particularly in more modern times some arithmetic might be added. In the third stage the Acts of the Apostles were studied, while certain prayers were also learnt, and writing and arithmetic continued. ... The fourth stage began with the study of the Psalms of David and was considered an important landmark in a child's education, being celebrated by the parents with a feast to which the teacher, father confessor, relatives and neighbours were invited. A boy who had reached this stage would moreover usually be able to write, and might act as a letter writer.[14]

However works of history and chronography, ecclesiastical and civil law, philology, medicine, and letters were also written in Geʻez.[which?]
The Ethiopian collection in the British Library comprises some 800 manuscripts dating from the 15th to the 20th centuries, notably including magical and divinatory scrolls, and illuminated manuscripts of the 16th to 17th centuries. It was initiated by a donation of 74 codices by the Church of England Missionary Society in the 1830s and 1840s, and substantially expanded by 349 codices, stolen by the British from the Emperor Tewodros II's capital at Magdala in the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has at least two illuminated manuscripts in Geʻez.
Origins[edit]
The Geʻez language is classified as a South Semitic language. It evolved from an earlier proto-Ethio-Semitic ancestor used to write royal inscriptions of the kingdom of Dʿmt in Epigraphic South Arabian. The Geʻez language is no longer universally thought of, as previously assumed, to be an offshoot of Sabaean or Old South Arabian,[15] and there is some linguistic (though not written) evidence of Semitic languages being spoken in Eritrea and Ethiopia since approximately 2000 BC.[16] However, the Geʻez script later replaced Epigraphic South Arabian in the Kingdom of Aksum. Epigraphic South Arabian letters were used for a few inscriptions into the 8th century, though not any South Arabian language since Dʿmt. Early inscriptions in Geʻez and Geʻez script have been dated[17] to as early as the 5th century BC, and in a sort of proto-Geʻez written in ESA since the 9th century BC. Geʻez literature properly begins with the Christianization of Ethiopia (and the civilization of Axum) in the 4th century, during the reign of Ezana of Axum.[citation needed]
5th to 7th centuries[edit]
The oldest known example of the old Geʻez script is found on the Hawulti obelisk in Matara, Eritrea. The oldest surviving Geʻez manuscript is thought to be the 5th or 6th century Garima Gospels.[18][19]
Almost all texts from this early "Aksumite" period are religious (Christian) in nature, many of them translations from Greek, Syriac, Coptic, and later also Arabic. The translation of the Christian Bible was undertaken by Syrian monks known as the Nine Saints, who had come to Ethiopia in the 5th century fleeing the Byzantine persecution of the Monophysites. The Ethiopic Bible contains 81 Books; 46 of the Old Testament and 35 of the New. A number of these Books are called "deuterocanonical" (or "apocryphal" according to certain Western theologians), such as the Ascension of Isaiah, Jubilees, Enoch, the Paralipomena of Baruch, Noah, Ezra, Nehemiah, Maccabees, and Tobit. The Book of Enoch in particular is notable since its complete text has survived in no other language.
Also to this early period dates Qerlos, a collection of Christological writings beginning with the treatise of Saint Cyril (known as Hamanot Rete’et or De Recta Fide). These works are the theological foundation of the Ethiopic Church. Another important religious document is Ser'ata Paknemis, a translation of the monastic Rules of Pachomius. Non-religious works translated in this period include Physiologus, a work of natural history also very popular in Europe.[20]
13th to 14th centuries[edit]
After the decline of the Aksumites, a lengthy gap follows; no works have survived that can be dated to the years of the 8th through 12th centuries. Only with the rise of the Solomonic dynasty around 1270 can we find evidence of authors committing their works to writings. Some writers consider the period beginning from the 14th century an actual "Golden Age" of Geʻez literature—although by this time Geʻez was no longer a living language. While there is ample evidence that it had been replaced by the Amharic language in the south and by the Tigrigna and Tigre languages in the north, Geʻez remained in use as the official written language until the 19th century, its status comparable to that of Medieval Latin in Europe.
Important hagiographies from this period include:

the Gadle Sama’etat "Acts of the Martyrs"
the Gadle Hawaryat "Acts of the Apostles"
the Senkessar or Synaxarium, translated as "The Book of the Saints of the Ethiopian Church"
Other Lives of Saint Anthony, Saint George, Saint Tekle Haymanot, Saint Gabra Manfas Qeddus

Also at this time the Apostolic Constitutions was translated in Geʻez, which provided another set of instructions and laws for the Ethiopian Church. Another translation from this period is Zena 'Ayhud, a translation (probably from an Arabic translation) of Joseph ben Gurion's "History of the Jews" ("Sefer Josippon") written in Hebrew in the 10th century, which covers the period from the Captivity to the capture of Jerusalem by Titus.
Apart from theological works, the earliest contemporary Royal Chronicles of Ethiopia are date to the reign of Amda Seyon I (1314–44). With the appearance of the "Victory Songs" of Amda Seyon, this period also marks the beginning of Amharic literature.
The 14th century Kebra Nagast or "Glory of the Kings" by the Nebura’ed Yeshaq of Aksum is among the most significant works of Ethiopian literature, combining history, allegory and symbolism in a retelling of the story of the Queen of Sheba (i.e. Saba), King Solomon, and their son Menelik I of Ethiopia. Another work that began to take shape in this period is the Mashafa Aksum or "Book of Axum".[21]
15th to 16th centuries[edit]
The early 15th century Fekkare Iyasus "The Explication of Jesus" contains a prophecy of a king called Tewodros, which rose to importance in 19th century Ethiopia as Tewodros II chose this throne name.
Literature flourished especially during the reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob. Written by the Emperor himself were Mats'hafe Berhan ("The Book of Light") and Mats'hafe Milad ("The Book of Nativity"). Numerous homilies were written in this period, notably Retu’a Haimanot ("True Orthodoxy") ascribed to John Chrysostom. Also of monumental importance was the appearance of the Geʻez translation of the Fetha Negest ("Laws of the Kings"), thought to have been around 1450, and ascribed to one Petros Abda Sayd — that was later to function as the supreme Law for Ethiopia, until it was replaced by a modern Constitution in 1931.
By the beginning of the 16th century, the Islamic invasions put an end to the flourishing of Ethiopian literature. A letter of Abba 'Enbaqom (or "Habakkuk") to Imam Ahmad Ibn Ibrahim, entitled Anqasa Amin ("Gate of the Faith"), giving his reasons for abandoning Islam, although probably first written in Arabic and later rewritten in an expanded Geʻez version around 1532, is considered one of the classics of later Geʻez literature.[22] During this period, Ethiopian writers begin to address differences between the Ethiopian and the Roman Catholic Church in such works as the Confession of Emperor Gelawdewos, Sawana Nafs ("Refuge of the Soul"), Fekkare Malakot ("Exposition of the Godhead") and Haymanote Abaw ("Faith of the Fathers"). Around the year 1600, a number of works were translated from Arabic into Geʻez for the first time, including the Chronicle of John of Nikiu and the Universal History of Jirjis ibn al'Amid Abi'l-Wasir (also known as al-Makin).
Current usage in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Israel[edit]
Geʻez is the liturgical language of Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Ethiopian Catholic and Eritrean Catholic Christians, and is used in prayer and in scheduled public celebrations. It is also used liturgically by the Beta Israel (Falasha Jews).
The liturgical rite used by the Christian churches is referred to as the Ethiopic rite[23][24][25][26] or the Geʻez rite.[27][28][29][30]
Sample[edit]

"Word of blessing of Henok, wherewith he blessed the chosen and righteous who would be alive in the day of tribulation for the removal of all wrongdoers and backsliders."
