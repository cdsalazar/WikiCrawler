The good life is a term for the life that one would like to live, or for happiness,[1] associated (as eudaimonia) with the work of Aristotle and his teaching on ethics.
People who hope for a better world feel the need for a shared vision of the "good life," a vision that is flexible enough for innumerable individual circumstances but comprehensive enough to unite people in optimistic, deliberate, progressive social change.[2]
