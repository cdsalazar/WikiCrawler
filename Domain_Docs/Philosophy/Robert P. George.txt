Education[edit]
George grew up in Morgantown, West Virginia,[1] the grandson of immigrant coal miners. He was educated at Swarthmore College (BA), Harvard Law School (JD in Law), Harvard Divinity School (MTS in Social Policy), and Oxford University (DPhil in Family Law).[2] At Oxford he studied under John Finnis and Joseph Raz.
Academic career[edit]
George joined the faculty of Princeton University as an instructor in 1985, and in the following year became an assistant professor (a tenure-track position).[citation needed] He spent 1988–89 on sabbatical leave as a Visiting Fellow in Law at Oxford University, working on his book Making Men Moral: Civil Liberties and Public Morality (1993, Oxford University Press).[citation needed] George was promoted to associate professor at Princeton in 1994, and to professor in 1999, being named to Princeton’s McCormick Chair of Jurisprudence, a celebrated endowed professorship previously held by Woodrow Wilson, Edward S. Corwin, Alpheus T. Mason, and Walter F. Murphy.[citation needed]
George founded Princeton’s James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions in 2000 and continues to serve as its director.[3] Since 2007, George has been teaching undergraduate seminars on leading thinkers in Western intellectual history with friend and colleague Cornel West, a leading left-wing public intellectual;[citation needed] readings have included Sophocles's Antigone, Plato's Gorgias, St. Augustine’s Confessions, Marx and Engels’s The Communist Manifesto, Du Bois’s The Souls of Black Folk, Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom, Gramsci’s Prison Notebooks, Strauss’s Natural Right and History, and King’s "Letter from Birmingham Jail".[citation needed] The George-West collaboration—allowing only 18 students, many fewer than want to attend[4] — has drawn attention on campus,[5] as well as off;[citation needed] it is widely noted as an example of how scholars can work together across ideological lines to enhance the quality of higher education.[citation needed]
Other professional and public service activities[edit]

George is of counsel to the law firm of Robinson &amp; McElwee PLLC in Charleston, West Virginia.[citation needed][timeframe?]
George served from 1993-1998 as a presidential appointee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights,[citation needed] and from 2002-2009 as a member of the President's Council on Bioethics.[citation needed] George was appointed to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012, and in the following year was elected to its Chair.[citation needed]
He is a former Judicial Fellow at the Supreme Court of the United States,[when?] receiving during his tenure there the Justice Tom C. Clark Award.[citation needed] He has served on UNESCO’s World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST), of which he remains a corresponding member.[timeframe?][citation needed] He is a member of the boards of the Ethics and Public Policy Center (where he is Vice-Chairman of the Board),[6] the American Enterprise Institute,[7] the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty,[8] the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation,[9][better&#160;source&#160;needed] and other organizations.[citation needed][timeframe?] George is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[10]
George has served or serves on the editorial boards of Touchstone[11] and Public Discourse magazines,[citation needed] as well as several academic journals.[clarification needed][citation needed] and the advisory council of First Things.[12]
Political activity[edit]
George twice served as Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Youth Conference, and attended the 1976 Democratic National Convention as an alternate delegate. George moved to the right in the 1980s, largely due to his views on abortion,[1] and left the Democratic Party as a result of what he saw as its increasingly strong commitment to legal abortion and its public funding, and his growing skepticism about the effectiveness of Great Society social welfare projects in Appalachia and other low income rural and urban areas. George founded the American Principles Project,[13] which aims to create a grass-roots movement around his ideas.[1] He is a past chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, an advocacy group opposed to same-sex marriage,[1] and co-founder of the Renewal Forum, an organization fighting the sexual trafficking and commercial exploitation of women and children.
George drafted the Manhattan Declaration, a manifesto signed by Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical leaders that "promised resistance to the point of civil disobedience against any legislation that might implicate their churches or charities in abortion, embryo-destructive research or same-sex marriage."[1]
Along with other public intellectuals, George played a key role in creating the "theoconservative" movement and integrating it into mainstream Republicanism.[14]
George was threatened with death by pro-abortion extremist Theodore Shulman, who also targeted Priests For Life director the Rev. Frank Pavone, saying that they would be killed if the accused killer of Dr. George Tiller (a Wichita abortion-provider) was acquitted.[15]

George holds honorary doctorates of law, letters, science, civil law, humane letters, ethics, divinity, and juridical science.
Perspectives of colleagues[edit]
Laudatory[edit]
George has been called America's "most influential conservative Christian thinker" by David Kirkpatrick of the New York TImes.[1] Kirkpatrick goes on to state:

"George’s admirers say he is revitalizing a strain of Catholic natural-law thinking that goes back to St. Thomas Aquinas. His scholarship has earned him accolades from religious and secular institutions alike. In one notable week two years ago, he received invitations to deliver prestigious lectures at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Harvard Law School."

In 2009, Supreme Court Justice and former Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan praised George as "one of the nation’s most respected legal theorists", saying that the respect he had gained was due to "his sheer brilliance, the analytic power of his arguments, the range of his knowledge", and "a deeply principled conviction, a profound and enduring integrity".[16] In announcing his election to Chair the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in 2013, outgoing Chairwoman Katrina Lantos Swett, a Democrat appointed by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, praised George as "a true human rights champion whose compassion for victims of oppression and wisdom about international religious freedom shine through all we have accomplished."[this quote needs a citation][17] George was described by the New Yorker in 2014 as "a widely respected conservative legal philosopher" who has "played [intellectual] godfather to right-leaning students on [the Princeton] campus."[18]
Critical[edit]





This section requires expansion with: balanced, sourced perspective, developed in parallel to next subsection, of laudatory and critical comments of reputable, notable individuals. (June 2015)


George's critics including many Catholic scholars, who have argued that he has neglected critical aspects of the Christian message, including "the corruption of human reason through original sin, the need for forgiveness and charity and the chance for redemption," focusing instead on "mechanics" of morality, and—through his political associations and activism—turned the church "into a tool of Republican Party".[1]
M. Cathleen Kaveny, formerly of Notre Dame Law School, and as of 2014, Darald and Juliet Libby Professor at Boston College, a comparably credentialed scholar of law as well as theology, and like George, "in the Thomistic tradition," has called George and his allies "ecclesiastical bullies" and "Rambo Catholics" for such statements as his comparison of Catholic scholars supporting abortion rights to "defenders of chattel slavery."[1]
Musical activity[edit]
George is a finger style guitarist and bluegrass banjo player. His guitar playing is in the style of Chet Atkins and Jerry Reed. His banjo playing mixes the styles of Earl Scruggs, Don Reno, and Bela Fleck. As a teenager, he performed with folk groups and bluegrass bands in coffee houses, rod and gun clubs, and at state and county fairs in West Virginia, Maryland, and Virginia. At Swarthmore he led "Robby George and Friends", a country and bluegrass band. He performs in New Jersey with the band "Blue Heart".[19]
