The philosophy of business considers the fundamental principles that underlie the formation and operation of a business enterprise; the nature and purpose of a business, and the moral obligations that pertain to it. The subject is important to business and management, and is closely related to business ethics and political economy. It is influenced significantly by philosophy, ethics, and economic theory.
The "philosophy of business" is different from "business philosophy". Business philosophy denotes a way of doing business or a business outlook, instead of the more academic philosophical meaning of philosophy of business".
