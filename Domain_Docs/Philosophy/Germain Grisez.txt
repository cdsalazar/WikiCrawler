				Germain Gabriel Grisez (born 1929) is a French-American philosopher.[1] Grisez's development of ideas from Thomas Aquinas has redirected Catholic thought and changed the way it has engaged with secular moral philosophy. In 'The First Principle of Practical Reason: A Commentary on the Summa Theologiae, I-II, Q. 94, A. 2' (1965) Grisez attacked the neo-scholastic interpretation of Aquinas as holding that moral norms are derived from methodologically antecedent knowledge of human nature. Grisez defends the idea of metaphysical free choice, and proposes a natural law theory of practical reasoning and moral judgement which, although broadly Thomistic, departs from Aquinas on significant points.[2]
Grisez is emeritus Professor of Christian Ethics at Mount St. Mary's University in Emmitsburg, MD.[3]
