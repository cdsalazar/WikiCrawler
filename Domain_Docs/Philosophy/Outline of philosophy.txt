The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to philosophy:
Philosophy – study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.[1][2] It is distinguished from other ways of addressing fundamental questions (such as mysticism, myth, or the arts) by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument.[3] The word "Philosophy" comes from the Greek philosophia (φιλοσοφία), which literally means "love of wisdom".[4][5][6]

Core areas of philosophy[edit]
The core areas of philosophy are:

Aesthetics – study of the nature of beauty, art, and taste, and the creation of personal kinds of truth
Epistemology – study of the nature and scope of knowledge and belief
Ethics – study of the right, the good, and the valuable. Includes study of applied ethics
Logic – study of good reasoning, by examining the validity of arguments and documenting their fallacies
Metaphysics – study of the state of being and the nature of reality

Fields of philosophy[edit]
The branches of philosophy are divided into the many fields of philosophy:
Ethics[edit]
Ethics – study of the right, the good, and the valuable

Applied ethics – philosophical examination, from a moral standpoint, of particular issues in private and public life that are matters of moral judgment. It is thus the attempts to use philosophical methods to identify the morally correct course of action in various fields of human life.

Decision ethics – ethical theories and ethical decision processes
Environmental ethics – studies ethical issues concerning the non-human world. It exerts influence on a large range of disciplines including environmental law, environmental sociology, ecotheology, ecological economics, ecology and environmental geography.
Professional ethics – ethics to improve professionalism

Computer ethics – deals with how computing professionals should make decisions regarding professional and social conduct

Ethics of artificial intelligence – specific to robots and other artificially intelligent beings.


Research ethics – application of fundamental ethical principles to a variety of topics involving research, including scientific research.


Bioethics – study of the typically controversial ethical issues emerging from new situations and possibilities brought about by advances in biology and medicine.

Medical ethics – ethics to improve our basic health needs


Business ethics – individual based morals to improve ethics in a business environment
Organizational ethics – ethics among organizations
Social ethics – ethics among nations and as one global unit


Descriptive ethics – study of people's beliefs about morality
Normative ethics – study of ethical theories that prescribe how people ought to act
Metaethics – branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments

Metaphysics[edit]
Metaphysics – traditional branch of philosophy concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it. Metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest possible terms: "What is ultimately there?" and, "What is it like?"

Ontology – philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations.
Philosophy of mind – studies the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.
Philosophy of space and time – branch of philosophy concerned with the issues surrounding the ontology, epistemology, and character of space and time.
Philosophy of action – theories about the processes causing willful human bodily movements of a more or less complex kind. This area of thought has attracted the strong interest of philosophers ever since Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics (Third Book).

^ Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: "Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose."

^ Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), The Oxford Companion to Philosophy (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: "Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less systematic kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved."
