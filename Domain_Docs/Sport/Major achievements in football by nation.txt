									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
								
												
					Jump to:					navigation, 					search
				
				This is a list of countries according to the best position achieved by national teams from these nations at major Association football, Futsal and Beach soccer tournaments sanctioned by FIFA, as well as the football tournaments at the Summer Olympic Games. Also included is minifootball; since it is not governed by FIFA, the WMF World Cup was selected as the most important tournament for this sport. Medals earned by athletes from defunct NOCs or historical teams have been merged with the results achieved by their immediate successor states, as follows: Russia inherits medals and trophies from the Soviet Union; Serbia inherits medals and trophies from Yugoslavia; Czech Republic inherits medals and trophies from Czechoslovakia; and Germany inherits medals from West Germany and East Germany. Olympic results from Great Britain were attributed to England. The table is pre-sorted by total number of first place results, second place results and third place results, respectively. When equal ranks are given, countries are listed in alphabetical order. Tournaments not officially organized by FIFA (such as the Women's Futsal World Tournament and the FIFUSA/AMF Futsal World Cup) were not considered in the making of this table, except for the WMF World Cup. U-15, U-17 and U-20 tournaments, the Blue Stars/FIFA Youth Cup as well as the football tournament at the Youth Olympics were also not taken into account. The FIFA Club World Cup is not eligible because national teams are not allowed to compete.
