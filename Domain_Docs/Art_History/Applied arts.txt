This street-sweeping machine appears to have been streamlined for purely aesthetic purposes, since it moves only at the walking pace of the operator.






The Normandie Hotel, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was inspired by the ocean liner SS Normandie. The streamlining of static objects was a common theme in Art Deco architecture.


The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday objects to make them aesthetically pleasing.[1] The term is applied in distinction to the fine arts which aims to produce objects which are beautiful and/or provide intellectual stimulation. In practice, the two often overlap.
The fields of industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design and the decorative arts are considered applied arts. In a creative and/or abstract context, the fields of architecture and photography are also considered applied arts.[citation needed]
