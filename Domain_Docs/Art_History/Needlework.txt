In a local fashion boutique in Bangalore, India, a craftsman seen busy with needlework on a designer-ware.


Needlework is a broad term for the handicrafts of decorative sewing and textile arts. Anything that uses a needle for construction can be called needlework.[1] The definition may expand to include related textile crafts such as a crochet hook or tatting shuttles.
Similar abilities often transfer well between different varieties of needlework, such as fine motor skill and a knowledge of textile fibers. Some of the same tools may be used in several different varieties of needlework. For instance, a needle threader is useful in nearly all needlecrafts.
