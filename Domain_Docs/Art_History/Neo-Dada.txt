				Neo-Dada is a minor audio and visual art movement that has similarities in method or intent to earlier Dada artwork. While it revived some of the objectives of dada, it put "emphasis on the importance of the work of art produced rather than on the concept generating the work".[1] It is the foundation of Fluxus, Pop Art and Nouveau réalisme.[2] Neo-Dada is exemplified by its use of modern materials, popular imagery, and absurdist contrast. It also patently denies traditional concepts of aesthetics.
The term was popularized by Barbara Rose in the 1960s and refers primarily, although not exclusively, to a group of artwork created in that and the preceding decade.
