				The Neue Künstlervereinigung München e.V (NKVM), ("Munich New Artist's Association", if literally translated from German) formed in 1909 in Munich around Wassily Kandinsky, and prefigured Der Blaue Reiter, the first modernist secession which is regarded as a forerunner and pathfinder for Modern art in 20th-century Germany.

Historical background[edit]
The founding members were Wassily Kandinsky (who initially proposed the group), Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, Gabriele Münter, Adolf Erbslöh and Alexander Kanoldt. These principal figures came together to study in Munich in 1909.
In 1909, 1910 and 1911, the NKVM organised three cycling exhibitions. The first cycle showed the original group and artists invited; the second cycle expanded to include French and Russian avant-garde artists such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque; the third and final cycle excluded most of the previous exhibitors, especially the secessionists of Der Blaue Reiter who launched their own parallel show in the same gallery, as a result of tensions within the NKVM.[1]
1st Cycle: "Turnus 1909–1910"[edit]
The catalogue of the first NKVM exhibition lists 128 items by 16 artists: Paul Baum, Wladimir von Bechtejeff, Erma Bossi, Dresler, Eckert, Erbslöh, Pierre Girieud, Karl Hofer, Jawlensky, Kandinsky, Kanoldt, Kogan, Alfreds Kubin, Münter, Pohle, Werefkin, and is accompanied by 14 reproductions and a list of prices.[2]
On view beginning on December 1, 1909, at the Moderne Galerie in Munich, this exhibition traveled to 9 venues:

December 1–15, 1909: Munich, Moderne Galerie Heinrich Thannhauser
Brünn
Elberfeld
Barmen
Hamburg
Düsseldorf
Wiesbaden
Schwerin
Frankfurt am Main.[3]

It received mainly negative criticism from the local press.
2nd Cycle: "Turnus 1910–1911"[edit]
The catalogue of the second NKVM exhibition lists 115 items by 29 artists: Bechtejew, Bossi, Braque, Derain, Kees van Dongen, Durio, Erbslöh, Le Fauconnier, Girieud, Haller, Hoetger, Jawlensky, von Kahler, Kandinsky, Kanoldt, Kogan, Kubin, Alexander Mogilewski, Münter, Nieder, Picasso, Rouault, Scharff, de Vlaminck, Werefkin, David Burljuk, Wladimir Burljuk, Denissoff, Soudbinine, and is accompanied by 20 reproductions and 2 pages of advertisements.[4]
On view from September 1, 1910, at the Moderne Galerie in Munich, this exhibition visited 8 venues in:

Moderne Galerie Munich
Karlsruhe, Mannheim
Hagen
Paul Cassirer Berlin
Leipzig
Galerie Arnold Dresden
Munich Weimar
Neue Secession Berlin[3]

3rd Cycle: "Turnus 1911–1912"[edit]
The third and final NKVM exhibition showed 58 paintings by 8 artists: Erma Barrera-Bossi, Wladimir von Bechtejeff, Adolf Erbslöh, Pierre Girieud, Alexej von Jawlensky, Alexander Kanoldt, Moissey Kogan and Marianne von Werefkin, and 8 illustrations – one for each participant.[5]
On view from December 18, 1911, at the Moderne Galerie in Munich, this exhibition originally was intended for 8 or 9 venues, but probably ceased to travel after the 2nd venue:

December 18, 1911 – January 1, 1912: Munich/München, Moderne Galerie

Köln
Elberfeld

Munich, Secession
