Early life[edit]
Honour was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, to Herbert and Dorothy (Withers) Honour. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from St Catharine's College, Cambridge.[1] While at Cambridge, Honour met John Fleming, a solicitor and amateur art historian, who would become Honour's life partner. Honour accepted a position as Assistant director of Leeds City Art Gallery and Temple Newsam House but left after one year to join Fleming in Italy.
Life in Italy[edit]
Living in Asolo near Venice, Honour and Fleming began a productive writing partnership. They were commissioned by publisher Allen Lane to edit the Style and Civilisation series (begun 1967), for which Honour wrote the volumes on Neo-classicism and Romanticism; the Architect and Society series (begun 1966); and the Art in Context series (begun 1972).[2]
In 1962, Honour and Fleming moved to Villa Marchiò near Lucca where they remained for the rest of their lives. In 1966, they collaborated with Nikolaus Pevsner to produce The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture (2nd edition 1972), and in 1977 they wrote The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts. A World History of Art followed in 1982 and the Venetian Hours of Henry James, Whistler and Sargent in 1991.
Honour was elected in 1972 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature [3]
