				Neo-Fauvism was a poetic style of painting from the mid-1920s proposed as a challenge to Surrealism.[1]
The magazine Cahiers d'Art was launched in 1926 and its writers mounted a challenge to the Surrealist practice of automatism by seeing it not in terms of unconscious expression, but as another development of traditional artistry. They identified a group of artists as the exponents of this and termed them Neo-Fauves.[1]
Although these artists were later mostly forgotten, the movement had an effect of disillusioning the Surrealist group with the technique of graphic automatism as a revolutionary means of by-passing conventional aesthetics, ideology and commercialism.[1]
Neo-Fauvism has been seen as the last trend within painting that could be marketed as a coherent style.[2]
