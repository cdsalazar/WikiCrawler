The Cave of the Trois-Frères is a cave in southwestern France famous for its cave paintings. It is located in Montesquieu-Avantès, in the Ariège département.
One of these, called "The Sorcerer" is as familiar as any art in the more famous cave of Lascaux. The cave also contained two finely modelled bison. The cave is part of a single cave-complex with the Tuc d'Audoubert, both galleries formed by the Volp River.
The cave art appears to date to approximately 13,000 BC.
The cave is named for the three sons of Comte Bégouen who discovered it in 1914. (In French: trois frères means "three brothers".) The drawings of the cave were made famous in the publications of the Abbé Henri Breuil.
