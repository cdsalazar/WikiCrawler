Architecture[edit]
Main article: Outline of architecture
In the art and science of architecture, the design and construction of buildings and interiors, infrastructure and other physical structures are created. It can involve multiple disciplines of brickwork, carpentry, engineering, stonemasonry and many other skills.

Cob
Glass
Metal
Stone, brick
Wood

Carpentry[edit]
The art of carpentry and woodworking is by a skilled craftsperson or joiner, who designs and builds buildings, furniture and other objects.

Adhesives
Wood (timber)

Ceramics[edit]
Main article: Ceramic art

Pottery
Ceramics

Drawing[edit]
Main article: Outline of drawing and drawings
In drawing, "media" refers to both the material that is manually applied and to the base onto which it is applied.[1] The media applied can be many things but the method of application is a stick type object with a point (not a brush) that transfers particles of media to the base. The point of the stick can be as minute as it can be large.
The most commonly practiced form of drawing or sketching is with a pencil and paper, however the wide and varied use of materials applied can be graphite, fusain, pastel, and ink among other things. Bases can be paper, plaster, canvas, wood or basically anything that accepts the medium applied from the point of the stick.
Traditional drawing media[edit]

Airbrush
Acrylic paint
Chalk
Charcoal (soft or hard)
Coloured pencil
Conté
Crayon
Gouache
Graphite (can be pencils which are small or large sticks similar to charcoal)

Electronic[edit]
Main articles: Electronic art, Digital art and Electronic media
In contrast to traditional art media, electronic art media are tools and materials such as computers and electronic media to produce electronic art either for electrical display or printing.
There are various application software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Painter, and Maya. These are some of the programs that artists use to modify photos, create new digital illustrations, or model 3D objects and turn them into full body animations. These electronic programs provide artists with added control, that is unlike traditional and physical hand crafted materials. Allowing instant alterations to modify, add or undo, and delete any actions made, at anytime when creating a work.
Digital artists achieve a level of industry and production quality that you see in marketing advertisements, on magazines, and special effects that you see in animated or live action films. There is also technical illustrations and visualization graphics which are made reconfigurable and scalable, with a high level of precise detail. Electronic media allows for art to be interactive and virtualized in ways not possible with traditional media.
Examples include electronic forms of traditional methods such as:

Graphic art software for illustration and animation
3D computer graphics for sculpture and 3D animation or virtual reality
Word processors and desktop publishing software for writing and page layout
Digital photography and digital cinematography for the capturing of photographs and footage
Specialized input devices (e.g. variable pressure sensing tablets and touchscreens) to bridge the gap between traditional techniques and digital painting
Digital printing to streamline the printing process
Programming to add interactivity and automated or computer simulation functions to the art

Film[edit]
Main articles: Outline of film and Cinematic techniques
In cinematography and film, a sequence of still images is captured with a video camera. A series of individual images are called frames. When these images are shown in rapid succession, a viewer gains the displayed illusion that motion is occurring.

Animation
Computer animation and computer-generated imagery
Live action
Live action and animation
Stop motion
Video Art

Food[edit]
Main article: Culinary art
In the cooking and baking industries, culinary art media include a chef's tools and equipment, including ovens, stoves, grills, and griddles. As well, specialty equipment may be used in kitchens across the world, including salamanders, French tops, woks, tandoors, and induction burners. Prepared dishes serve as a visual art for the consumer, an olfactory art with different aromas resonating from the food, and occasionally an auditory art (e.g. with tandoor-cooked or crunchy foods). The taste, including layers of flavor in a dish, also serve to influence the consumer's appreciation of the finished product.
Light[edit]
Further information: Lighting designer
The illumination of light as a practical use to reveal what may be shaded or dark is common. Light as an art form is a function of art works and entertainment, it is a projection source and a backlighting source, for colours, focal or focus points and can be an element to enhance or change atmosphere or mood in areas or on objects.
Literature[edit]
Main articles: Literature and Writing implement
The art of written words and typography is traditionally an ink and printed form on paper or is creatively written with many forms of mediums.

Painting[edit]
Main article: Outline of painting
In painting, "media" refers to both the type of paint used and the base (or ground) to which it is applied. A paint's medium refers to what carries a paint's pigments (colors), and is also called a "vehicle", "base" or binder.
