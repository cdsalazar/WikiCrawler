An ideogram or ideograph (from Greek ·º∞Œ¥Œ≠Œ± id√©a "idea" and Œ≥œÅŒ¨œÜœâ gr√°ph≈ç "to write") is a graphic symbol that represents an idea or concept, independent of any particular language, and specific words or phrases. Some ideograms are comprehensible only by familiarity with prior convention; others convey their meaning through pictorial resemblance to a physical object, and thus may also be referred to as pictograms.

Terminology[edit]
Further information: Character (symbol) and Logogram
In proto-writing, used for inventories and the like, physical objects are represented by stylized or conventionalized pictures, or pictograms. For example, the pictorial Dongba symbols without Geba annotation cannot represent the Naxi language, but are used as a mnemonic for reciting oral literature.[1] Some systems also use ideograms, symbols denoting abstract concepts.
The term "ideogram" is often used to describe symbols of writing systems such as Egyptian hieroglyphs, Sumerian cuneiform and Chinese characters. However, these symbols are logograms, representing words or morphemes of a particular language rather than objects or concepts. In these writing systems, a variety of strategies were employed in the design of logographic symbols. Pictographic symbols depict the object referred to by the word, such as an icon of a bull denoting the Semitic word  æƒÅlep "ox". Some words denoting abstract concepts may be reprented iconically, but most other words are represented using the rebus principle, borrowing a symbol for a similarly-sounding word. Later systems used selected symbols to represent the sounds of the language, for example the adaptation of the logogram for  æƒÅlep "ox" as the letter aleph representing the initial sound of the word, a glottal stop.
Many signs in hieroglyphic as well as in cuneiform writing could be used either logographically or phonetically. For example, the Akkadian sign AN (íÄ≠) could be an ideograph for "deity", an ideogram for the god Anum in particular, a logograph for the Akkadian stem il- "deity", a logograph for the Akkadian word ≈°amu "sky", or a syllabogram for either the syllable an or il.
Although Chinese characters are logograms, two of the smaller classes in the traditional classification are ideographic in origin:

Simple ideographs (Êåá‰∫ãÂ≠ó zh«êsh√¨z√¨) are abstract symbols such as ‰∏ä sh√†ng "up" and ‰∏ã xi√† "down" or numerals such as ‰∏â sƒÅn "three".
Semantic compounds (‰ºöÊÑèÂ≠ó hu√¨y√¨z√¨) are semantic combinations of characters, such as Êòé m√≠ng "bright", composed of Êó• r√¨ "sun" and Êúà yu√® "moon", or ‰ºë xi≈´ "rest", composed of ‰∫∫ r√©n "person" and Êú® m√π "tree". In the light of the modern understanding of Old Chinese phonology, researchers now believe that most of the characters originally classified as semantic compounds have an at least partially phonetic nature.[2]
