In 1950s the Finnish artists looked for foreign influence: first in Paris, then in United States but also in Stockholm, whede modern art exhibitions were organized in Moderna museet.

When Vanni's monumental painting Contrapunctus (1959) won competition for mural in Helsinki, abstract art was considered to be accepted and established in Finland.[3]
Informalism spread quickly in 1950s and 1960s, when it was considered a new approach to landscape painting. It was also building on strong tradition of expressionism. It spread even outside of large cities.[3]
The Finnish contemporary art scene became much more visible than beforewith the establishment of Kiasma, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki in 1998.[4]
