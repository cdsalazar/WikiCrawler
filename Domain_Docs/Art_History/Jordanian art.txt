There are many forms of Jordanian art. Art in Jordan is plentiful, there are many local artists, as well as Arab and those who live abroad frequently have exhibitions in different art galleries in Jordan. In addition to an art museum in Jabal Luwiebdeh, there is Darat Al Funun, a very prestigious art center that frequently holds exhibitions by local, Arab and international artists. It is too in Jabal Luwiebdeh, but there are many other art centers that too hold exhibitions.
